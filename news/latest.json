      "summary_tr_long": "Zelensky moves towards demilitarised zones in latest peace plan for Ukraine Paul Kirby Europe digital editor Getty Images Zelensky said the 20 points agreed with the Americans offered Ukraine security guarantees that mirrored Nato membership Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has given details of an updated peace plan offering Russia the potential withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the east and the creation of a demilitarised zone in their place. Detailing the 20-point plan agreed by US and Ukrainian envoys in Florida at the weekend, Zelensky said the Russians would respond on Wednesday once the Americans had spoken to them. Describing the plan as \"the main framework for ending the war\", he said it proposed security guarantees from the US, Nato and Europeans for a co-ordinated military response if Russia invaded Ukraine again. On the key question of Ukraine's eastern Donbas, Zelensky said a \"free economic zone\" was a potential option. He told journalists that as Ukraine was against withdrawal, US negotiators were looking to establish a demilitarised zone or a free economic zone. \"There are two options,\" Zelensky said, \"either the war continues, or something will have to be decided regarding all potential economic zones.\" The 20-point plan is seen as an update of an original 28-point document, agreed by US envoy Steve Witkoff with the Russians several weeks ago, which was widely seen as heavily geared towards the Kremlin's demands. The Russians have insisted that Ukraine pulls out of almost a quarter of its own territory in the eastern Donetsk region in return for a peace deal. Sensitive issues including questions over territory would have to be resolved \"at the leaders' level\", but the new draft would provide Ukraine with strong security guarantees and a military strength of 800,000, Zelensky explained. Much of the updated plan resembles what came out of recent talks in Berlin involving US negotiators Witkoff and Jared Kushner with Ukrainian and European leaders. The setting then moved to Miami last weekend where US President Donald Trump's team spoke separately to Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev and then Ukrainian and European officials. There now appears to be far more detail on the territorial issue, although it is clear the Ukrainian side was unable to reach a consensus with the Americans. Zelensky explained that if Ukraine was prepared to pull its heavy forces back by five, 10 or 40km in the 25% of Donetsk it still held to create an economic zone, making it virtually demilitarised, then Russia would have to do the same \"accordingly by five, 10, or 40km\". Russian troops are currently about 40km (25 miles) east of Ukraine's \"fortress belt\" cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, having captured the town of Siversk . Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to be impressed by the kind of compromise being proposed for Donetsk. He said this month that Russia would take control of the entire east of Ukraine by force if Ukrainian troops did not pull out. However, Trump is pushing for a deal to end almost four years of full-scale war and the Ukrainian president believes Russia cannot afford to reject the US plan. \"If they try to obstruct everything, then President Trump would have to arm us heavily, while imposing all possible sanctions against them.\" Zelensky made clear that if a free economic zone were established in Donetsk it would have to be under Ukrainian administration and police - \"definitely not the so-called Russian police\". The current front line would then become the boundary of the economic zone with international forces on the ground along the contact line to ensure no Russian infiltration. Russia has so far rejected a European proposal to police any peace deal through a Coalition of the Willing as a \"brazen threat\". A referendum would need to be held on the whole peace plan, Zelensky said, and only a referendum could decide on the idea of a potential free economic zone in Donbas. He emphasised that an economic zone would also have to be set up around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant currently occupied by Russia, and that Russian troops would have to pull out of four other Ukrainian regions - Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Sumy, and Kharkiv. The current US proposal for the nuclear plant would be for Ukraine, the US and Russia to operate it jointly, but Kyiv disagreed with that, Zelensky said. The main points of the plan reaffirm Ukraine's sovereignty and propose a non-aggression pact between Russia and its neighbour with a monitoring mechanism. As well as strong security guarantees mirroring Nato's Article Five, which requires members to aid an ally under attack, Ukraine is to be allowed a maximum military strength of 800,000 in peacetime. Discussions are still going on over a US plan to receive compensation in return for security guarantees, so Zelensky says it is not currently part of the document. There is no reference barring Ukraine from joining Nato, which was in the original 28-point plan and something Russia has consistently demanded. And the latest framework proposes that Ukraine joins the European Union with a defined date of accession. It is currently a candidate, but a number of other candidate countries are seen as first in line, such as Albania. There are plans for a Ukraine investment fund of about $200bn (£150bn) involving both the US and Europe. Among the other points is a requirement for Ukraine to hold elections as soon as possible after the deal is signed. Russia and the US have both pushed for a vote, even though Ukraine is under martial law because of the full-scale invasion.",

      "summary_tr": "In the latest release of files on Tuesday, a 2001 email sent by a person identified as \"A\" from \"Balmoral\" to Epstein's accomplice and close associate Ghislaine Maxwell - who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking of minors and other offences- asks: \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\" The BBC has contacted Andrew's team for a response.",
      "summary_tr_long": "US authorities have discovered more than a million more documents potentially related to the late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein that they plan to release in the coming days and weeks, officials say. The FBI and federal prosecutors in New York informed the Department of Justice (DoJ) of the discovery. \"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible,\" the DoJ said on Wednesday. The department said it could take \"a few more weeks\" before all the files are released. The DoJ has been under scrutiny after not releasing all Epstein files by 19 December, the deadline mandated under a new law. The agency said it would \"continue to fully comply with federal law and President Trump's direction to release the files\". The statement did not specify how the FBI and the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York came across the additional material. Epstein had been facing charges of sex trafficking minors in the state when he died awaiting trial in a New York prison. The news comes after the justice department released thousands of documents - some heavily redacted - related to their investigations into Epstein. The department has been releasing the documents in batches and top officials have said hundreds of thousands of documents still are to be released. The files were released after Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act - signed into law by US President Donald Trump - that ordered the agency to share all the documents with the public while protecting victims' identities. Many of the released documents, which include videos, photos, emails and investigative documents, have heavy redactions, including names of people the FBI appears to cite as possible co-conspirators in the Epstein case. The justice department has faced criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle over the amount of redactions, which the law permits only to protect victims' identities and active criminal investigations. In a post on X after the discovery of the additional documents was announced, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, a congressional panel that has been investigating the Epstein saga, accused the White House of “illegally” withholding the files. “Every day we see lies, incompetence, missed deadlines, and illegal redactions,” Representative Robert Garcia said in a statement. The law passed by Congress and signed last month by Trump states that names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted. It specifically asks the DoJ for internal communications and memos detailing who was investigated and decisions on whether \"to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates\". Included in the documents are emails appearing to be exchanged between FBI personnel in 2019 that mention 10 possible \"co-conspirators\" of Epstein . The emails said six of the group had been served with subpoenas. This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut. Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the justice department. Previous releases of Epstein documents have included revelations that reverberated across the Atlantic. Peter Mandelson was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US after details emerged about his friendship with the convicted paedophile, and that he told Epstein \"I think the world of you\", the day before Epstein began his sentence for soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008. Lord Mandelson said in a letter to staff that \"I deeply regret\" the circumstances of his departure from the British embassy in Washington DC. He said being ambassador had been \"the privilege of my life\" and he continued \"to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein twenty years ago and the plight of his victims\". In October, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lost his prince title and was asked to leave his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, following prolonged scrutiny over his links to Epstein. In the latest release of files on Tuesday, a 2001 email sent by a person identified as \"A\" from \"Balmoral\" to Epstein's accomplice and close associate Ghislaine Maxwell - who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking of minors and other offences- asks: \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\" The BBC has contacted Andrew's team for a response. He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and said he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his [Epstein's] arrest and conviction\".",

The conservative National Party candidate - backed by US President Donald Trump - won with 40.3% of the vote, according to the National Electoral Council (CNE), edging out Salvador Nasralla of the centre-right Liberal Party, who got 39.5%. In a post on X, Asfura said: \"Honduras: I am ready to govern. I will not let you down.\" Meanwhile, Nasralla said at a press conference: \"I will not accept a result built on omissions.\" But he also urged his supporters to remain calm. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged all parties to respect the result \"so that Honduran authorities may ensure a peaceful transition of authority\". But the president of the country's Congress, Luis Redondo, posted saying the result was \"completely illegal\". The vote was held on 30 November but the count was delayed twice by technical outages, which electoral officials called \"inexcusable\". The president of the CNE, Ana Paola Hall, blamed the private company tasked with tabulating the results for the delay. She said the firm had carried out maintenance without warning or checking with the CNE. The stoppage came a day after the portal displaying real-time results had crashed. Results of the election were tight and, because of the tumultuous nature of the processing system, around 15% of the tally sheets had to be counted by hand for the winner to be decided. There have been tensions in Honduras as a result of the delays with protests held across the country last week. Thousands of supporters of the governing Libre party demonstrated in the capital Tegucigalpa over what they considered fraud in the vote. The outgoing President, Xiomara Castro, had alleged that an \"electoral coup\" was taking place and earlier this month said the election was being marred by \"interference\" from Trump. When he endorsed Asfura for president, Trump said there would be \"hell to pay\" if his very narrow lead was overturned in the count. He also threatened to withdraw financial support from the US if Asfura didn't win. In a surprise move, the US president also pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, a member of Asfura's National Party, who was serving a 45-year jail sentence in the US on drug and weapons charges. Castro was barred by the constitution from standing for a second term. Nine days after the vote, Nasralla accused \"corrupt people\" of manipulating the vote count in the Central American nation. He also said Trump's comments had damaged his chances of winning. In his statement following the announcement of the result, Rubio said the US would \"look forward to working with his incoming administration to advance our bilateral and regional security co-operation\", adding the two countries would \"end illegal immigration\" to the US, while strengthening economic ties.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has asked an appeals court to release him from prison and overturn his conviction on two prostitution-related crimes. In a court filing for an expedited appeal, the rap mogul's attorney argued that he was improperly sentenced, and that the conduct that resulted in his conviction was not criminal in nature. Attorney Alexandra Shapiro called Combs' 50-month prison sentence \"unlawful, unconstitutional, and a perversion of justice\". She asked an appeals court to order that Combs be resentenced, should the panel choose not to throw out his conviction in its entirety. The request is the latest attempt by his team to reduce his sentence or throw out his conviction. The Southern District of New York, which prosecuted Combs, declined to comment on the request to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Combs' lawyers had previously said they would appeal his sentence and conviction. Federal prosecutors in New York accused Combs of using his money, power, and the threat of violence to coerce women into unwanted sexual encounters. During a high-profile trial this spring, the jury heard from two of Combs' ex-girlfriends, Cassie Ventura and a woman who testified as \"Jane Doe\". They said Combs abused them and forced them to participate in so-called \"freak-offs\" with male escorts. The jury found Combs not guilty of the two most serious charges: racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. They convicted him of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. In September, after his conviction, Combs asked Judge Arun Subramanian to consider an acquittal or new trial, citing objections over the way an anti-prostitution statute known as the Mann Act was used to prosecute Combs. Ahead of his sentencing, Combs' attorneys argued he should receive a brief sentence that would essentially amount to time served, a request that would have paved the way for a swift release. Prosecutors, however, asked the judge to send Combs to prison for at least 11 years. US District Judge Arun Subramanian ultimately sentenced Combs to more than four years in prison. He said he considered Combs' contributions to society and testimonials from family and friends, but \"a history of good works can't wash away your record\". Combs' appeal argues that Judge Subramanian did not properly follow sentencing guidelines when sending him to 50-months in prison. It argues the judge \"flouted\" new guidelines and improperly considered conduct for which Combs had been acquitted when formulating his punishment. The filing argues the judge \"acted as a thirteenth juror\" in the case and calls the sentence \"draconian\". Before Judge Subramanian issued his sentence, Combs apologized to Ms Ventura and \"Jane.\" \"My actions were disgusting, shameful, and sick,\" Combs said. \"I got lost in excess, I got lost in my ego.\" Combs is also facing dozens of pending civil lawsuits, which accuse him of sexual assault, rape and sexual exploitation. Many of the lawsuits allege that the rapper used his fame and power to silence accusers through threats. Some detail allegations that the rapper - or those who worked for him - drugged people at parties before alleged assaults. Representatives for Mr Combs have repeatedly said he \"never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor\".",

      "summary_tr_long": "Algeria's parliament has unanimously passed a law declaring France's colonisation of the North African state a crime, and demanding an apology and reparations. The law also criminalises the glorification of colonialism, state-run TV reports. The vote is the latest sign of increasingly strained diplomatic relations between the two countries, with some observers saying they are at their lowest since Algeria gained independence 63 years ago. France's colonisation of Algeria between 1830 and 1962 was marked by mass killings, large-scale deportations and ended in a bloody war of independence. Algeria says the war killed 1.5 million people, while French historians put the death toll much lower. France's President Emmanuel Macron has previously acknowledged the colonisation of Algeria was a \"crime against humanity\" but has not offered an apology. Lawmakers wore scarves in the colours of the national flag and chanted \"long live Algeria\" as they applauded the bill's passage through parliament, AFP news agency reports. It says the legislation states that France has \"legal responsibility\" for the \"tragedies it caused\", and \"full and fair\" compensation was an \"inalienable right of the Algerian state and people\". France has not yet commented on the vote. It comes at a time of growing pressure on Western powers to offer reparations for slavery and colonialism, and to return looted artefacts still kept in their museums. Algerian lawmakers have been demanding that France return a 16th Century bronze canon, known as Baba Merzoug, meaning \"Blessed Father\", that was regarded as the protector of Algiers, now Algeria's capital. French forces captured the city in 1830, on their third attempt, and removed the cannon - which is now in the port city of Brest in north-western France. In 2020, France returned the remains of 24 Algerian fighters who were killed resisting French colonial forces in the 19th Century. Last month, Algeria hosted a conference of African states to push for justice and reparations. Algeria's Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf said that a legal framework would ensure that restitution was neither regarded as \"a gift nor a favour\". Diplomatic relations between between Algeria and France soured last year, when Macron announced France was recognising Moroccan sovereignty of Western Sahara and backed a plan for limited autonomy for the disputed territory. Algeria backs the pro-independence Polisario Front in Western Sahara and is seen as its main ally. French-Algerian novelist Boualem Sansal was then arrested at Algiers airport in and jailed for five years, before being pardoned by Algeria's President Abdelmadjid Tebboune last month. Prosecutors said he had undermined national security for making remarks that questioned Algeria's borders.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Democratic lawmaker sues to remove Trump's name from Kennedy Center Watch: President Trump's name added to facade of Kennedy Center Democratic US Representative Joyce Beatty has filed a lawsuit seeking to remove President Donald Trump's name from the John F. Last week, the board of the Kennedy Center - which Trump filled with allies - voted to rename the performing arts centre the Trump-Kennedy Center. Beatty is one of several Democratic lawmakers designated as members of the board by US law. She claimed in her lawsuit that the renaming was illegal because changing the name requires \"an act of Congress\". The suit says Beatty had called into the meeting about the name change but was muted when she tried to voice her opposition. Beatty argues that Congress intended for the centre to be a \"living memorial\" to former President Kennedy. \"[I]n scenes more reminiscent of authoritarian regimes than the American republic – the sitting President and his handpicked loyalists renamed this storied center after President Trump,\" the lawsuit states. In a statement provided to the BBC, the White House said Trump had \"stepped up\" and saved the Kennedy Center \"by strengthening its finances, modernizing the building, and ending divisive woke programming\". \"As a result, the Board of the Kennedy Center voted unanimously to rename it the Trump-Kennedy Center — a historic move that marks a new era of success, prestige, and restored grandeur for one of America's most iconic cultural institutions,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston said. On Friday, the president's name was added to the exterior of the building, and the centre's website logo now reads \"The Trump Kennedy Center\". The name change has been met with harsh criticism, particularly in Washington DC where the centre has been an iconic landmark since it was built and named for Kennedy. Bloomberg via Getty Images Construction began on a performing arts centre in the 1950s and after Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Congress decided to name it after him. Shortly after taking office, Trump fired a slew of the centre's board members and replaced them with allies, who then voted to make him chairman of the board. His close adviser Richard Grenell became board president. The centre's board of trustees currently has 34 members appointed by Trump and 23 others designated as members by US law, according to the centre's website. Trump also secured about $257m (£190m) in congressional funding to pay for major renovations and other costs at the venue, saying it was in \"bad shape\". Several members of the Kennedy family took to social media to criticise the name change. Joe Kennedy III, a former House member and grandnephew of the late president, said that \"the Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law\". \"It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,\" he added.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Eleven suspects have been arrested in connection with a mass shooting that left nine people dead at a tavern in South Africa on Sunday. Police launched a manhunt for the 12 unidentified gunmen who had opened fire at patrons at around 01:00 local time (23:00 GMT Saturday) in the Bekkersdal establishment, near Johannesburg. On Wednesday, provincial deputy commissioner of police, Major General Fred Kekana said nine of the arrested suspects are Lesotho nationals, while one is from Mozambique. Another suspect, believed to be a South African mineworker, was also detained. Murders in South Africa – which has one of the highest rates in the world - are often the result of arguments, robberies and gang violence. While the attack appeared \"unprovoked\" at the time, preliminary investigations now appear to suggest a motive linked to illegal mining turf wars. During the attack, gunmen continued to shoot as people fled the tavern, killing two as well as a taxi driver who had dropped off a passenger nearby. Upon making the arrests, several unlicensed firearms including an AK-47 rifle, were found in the suspects' possession. There are about 3m legally held firearms in South Africa and at least the same number of unlicensed weapons, according to statistics cited by Gideon Joubert from the South African Gunowners' Association, Although 2025 has seen a decline in reported mass shootings, there has been a significant increase in incidents where four or more people are either killed or injured since 2020, Claire Taylor, a researcher at campaign group Gun Free South Africa, told the BBC. Among the most common locations for these attacks are licensed taverns or illegal drinking spots, known locally as shebeens. Sunday's shooting occurred just two weeks after another attack at the Saulsville Hostel in the capital Pretoria, where eleven people including a three-year-old child were killed .",

      "summary_tr_long": "Two British campaigners are among five people denied US visas after the State Department accused them of seeking to \"coerce\" American tech platforms into suppressing free speech. Imran Ahmed, an ex-Labour adviser who now heads the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), and Clare Melford, CEO of the Global Disinformation Index (GDI), were labelled \"radical activists\" by the Trump administration and banned from entering the US. A French ex-EU commissioner and two senior figures at a Germany-based anti-online hate group were also denied visas. European leaders have condemned the measures, while the UK government said it is \"fully committed\" to upholding free speech. \"While every country has the right to set its own visa rules, we support the laws and institutions which are working to keep the internet free from the most harmful content,\" a UK government spokesperson said. French President Emmanuel Macron described the travel ban as \"intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty\" while the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was \"unacceptable and an attempt to challenge our sovereignty\". The US billed the measures as a response to people and organisations that have campaigned for restrictions on American tech firms, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying they belonged to a \"global censorship-industrial complex\". He said: \"President Trump has been clear that his America First foreign policy rejects violations of American sovereignty. Extraterritorial overreach by foreign censors targeting American speech is no exception.\" Ahmed from the CCDH, which says it advocates for government action against hate speech and disinformation online, has links to senior Labour figures. He was previously an aide to Labour minister Hilary Benn, and Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney has served as a director of the group he founded. The US government labelled Ahmed a \"collaborator\" for the CCDH's purported past work with the Biden administration. BBC News has contacted the CCDH for comment. Melford founded the GDI, a non-profit that monitors the spread of disinformation, in 2018. US Undersecretary of State Sarah B Rogers accused the GDI of using US taxpayer money \"to exhort censorship and blacklisting of American speech and press\". A GDI spokesperson told the BBC that \"the visa sanctions announced today are an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship\". \"The Trump Administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor, and silence voices they disagree with. Their actions today are immoral, unlawful, and un-American.\" Also targeted was Thierry Breton, the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, who suggested that a \"witch hunt\" was taking place. Breton was described by the State Department as the \"mastermind\" of the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), which imposes content moderation on social media firms. However, it has angered some US conservatives who see it as seeking to censor right-wing opinions. Breton has clashed with Elon Musk, the world's richest man and owner of X, over obligations to follow EU rules. The European Commission recently fined X €120m (£105m) over its blue tick badges - the first fine under the DSA . It said the platform's blue tick system was \"deceptive\" because the firm was not \"meaningfully verifying users\". In response, Musk's site blocked the Commission from sharing adverts on its platform. Reacting to the visa ban, Breton posted on X: \"To our American friends: Censorship isn't where you think it is.\" Also subject to bans were Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon of HateAid, a German organisation that the State Department said helped enforce the DSA. In a statement to the BBC, the two CEOs called it an \"act of repression by a government that is increasingly disregarding the rule of law and trying to silence its critics by any means necessary\". They added: \"We will not be intimidated by a government that uses accusations of censorship to silence those who stand up for human rights and freedom of expression.\"",

Two traffic police officers saw a \"suspicious individual\" near a police car on the city's Yeletskaya Street, and when they approached the suspect to detain him, an explosive device was detonated, Russia's Investigative Committee has said. Reports in Russia say the third person killed was the suspect, but this has not been officially confirmed. The blast took place close to the location where a senior Russian general was killed in a car bombing in the capital on Monday. Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov died after an explosive device - which had been planted under a car - was detonated. Investigate Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement on Telegram that a criminal case was being investigated in Moscow \"regarding an attempt on the lives of traffic police officers\". The officers have been named by Russian media as Ilya Klimanov, 24, and Maxim Gorbunov, 25. Sources in Ukraine's military intelligence agency, HUR, told the BBC that a local resident, eliminated two representatives of the Russian law enforcement agency, \"as a sign of disagreement with the Kremlin's aggressive policy\" and said that a man \"threw an explosive package through the car window, causing an explosion\". According to the HUR sources, two other people were taken to hospital with serious injuries. Ukrainian military sources also told the BBC on Wednesday that the two officers killed had \"participated in hostilities against Ukraine,\" and added there was \"evidence of their involvement in the torture of Ukrainian prisoners of war\". There are no details and Moscow has not commented. Speaking to Reuters news agency, Alexander, a resident who lives close by, said: \"There was an explosion. \"It was loud bang - like with the car a few days ago.\" Russia said it suspected Ukraine was behind Monday's explosion, without providing any evidence. However Ukraine has not said whether it was involved in Fanil Sarvarov's death. It is also not known whether the two explosions are linked. Sarvarov, 56, was the head of the armed forces' operational training department. He was the third military official to have been killed in bomb attacks in the Russian capital over the last year.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Venezuela has accused the United States of the \"greatest extortion\" at an emergency session of the UN Security Council in New York. Washington's seizure of two Venezuelan oil tankers was \"worse than piracy,\" the Venezuelan ambassador to the UN said. The emergency meeting of the Security Council was called to discuss the seizure of the tankers, which took place off the coast of Venezuela earlier this month. The US has also said it was pursuing a third Venezuelan oil tanker. President Trump has accused Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro of leading a drugs cartel and said gangs had operated with impunity for too long. On 16 December, Trump ordered a naval blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela. The US president has said the US will keep or sell the crude oil it has taken, as well as the vessels themselves. The US has been building up its military presence in the Pacific and Caribbean Seas in recent months, sending 15,000 troops and a range of aircraft carriers and warships to the area. It is the largest deployment to the region since the US invaded Panama in 1989, and the stated aim is to stop the flow of fentanyl and cocaine to the US. The US has carried out strikes on what it says are Venezuelan drug-smuggling boats, targeting more than 20 vessels and killing at least 100 people. Some experts say the strikes could violate laws governing armed conflict. Venezuela's envoy to the UN said the US was subjecting his country to the \"greatest extortion\" in its history. Speaking at the UN Security Council meeting on Tuesday, Samuel Moncada said \"we are in the presence of a power that acts outside of international law, demanding that Venezuelans vacate our country and hand it over.\" Regarding the US seizure of Venezuelan oil, he added: \"We are talking about pillaging, looting and recolonisation of Venezuela. \"The government of the United States does not have jurisdiction in the Caribbean.\" Referring to the Venezuelan oil industry, he said: \"What does that have to do with drugs?\" In response, the US Ambassador to the UN, Michael Waltz, told the Security Council the US does not recognise Mr Maduro as the legitimate leader of Venezuela. \"Maduro's ability to sell Venezuela's oil enables his fraudulent claims to power and his narco-terrorist activities,\" Mr Waltz said. On a visit to a trade fair in Caracas, President Maduro said \"the Security Council is giving overwhelming support to Venezuela.\" Russia and China accused the US of bullying and aggression. The US was \"illegally destroying\" civilian vessels in the Caribbean Sea, the Russian ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, told the UN meeting. He warned that other countries could be next. The US actions against Venezuelan vessels, he said, were \"a template for future acts of force against Latin American states.\" Meanwhile, China's envoy to the UN, Sun Lei, called on the US to \"immediately halt relevant actions and avoid further escalation of tensions.\"",

      "summary_tr_long": "The Libyan army chief has been killed in an air crash in Turkey, Libya's prime minister has said. Gen Mohammed Ali Ahmed al-Haddad was on board a Falcon 50 aircraft flying out of the Turkish capital, Ankara, on Tuesday evening. He was killed along with four other military officials and three crew members. Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said signal with the business jet was lost at 20:52 local time (17:52 GMT) - about 42 minutes after it took off from Ankara's airport. The Tripoli-bound jet had issued an emergency landing request before contact was lost. The aircraft's wreckage was later found south-west of Ankara, and its voice recorder and black box had been recovered. The emergency services are still trying to retrieve the bodies. An investigation is under way into what caused the crash. In a post on X, Yerlikaya wrote that police had spotted the debris near the village of Kesikkavak, in the Haymana district. In Libya, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, the prime minister of the country's internationally-recognised Government of National Unity (GNU), said he had received news of the deaths of Gen Haddad and other senior Libyan military officials on board the jet. The prime minister called it a \"great loss\" for the nation, saying Libya had \"lost men who served their country with sincerity and dedication\". Gen Haddad and his team had been in Turkey for talks aimed at further strengthening military and security co-operation between the two countries. Turkey has played an increasingly dominant role in Libya after intervening in 2019 to prevent an army from the east of the country driving out the internationally-recognised government in Tripoli, and has built close political, military and economic ties. Libya's rival Government of National Stability (GNS) in the east of the country is run by military strongman Khalifa Haftar. The north African has been battered by many armed groups who emerged after the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. A series of armed uprisings that led to the long-time dictator's killing created a security vacuum, with much of the country lawless and chaotic since.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Trump trips, a fake video and 10 possible co-conspirators: Takeaways from new Epstein files Watch: The BBC reports on the latest Epstein file release The US Department of Justice (DoJ) released its latest - and largest - tranche of files on Jeffrey Epstein on Tuesday. The 11,000-plus documents continue a stream of released information that began on Friday, the deadline mandated in a law that required the department to publicly release all of its investigative files into the late convicted sex offender. Many of the documents released on Tuesday were redacted with names and information blacked out, including names of people who the FBI appears to cite as possible co-conspirators in the Epstein case. US President Donald Trump's name appeared more in these new documents than in previous releases. Emails between 'A' and Maxwell about 'girls' Of the thousands of pages included in this latest release, one 2001 email sent by a person identified as \"A\" stands out. \"A\" then asks Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking of minors and other offences: \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\" In another email sent later that day, Maxwell writes back: \"So sorry to dissapoint [sic] you, however the truth must be told. I have only been able to find appropriate friends.\" The \"A\" email was sent from the address abx17@dial.pipex.com, with the sender's name shown as \"The Invisible Man\". FBI email suggests 10 possible 'co-conspirators' US Department of Justice The name of Ghislaine Maxwell (R) is one of two names not redacted on an FBI list Among the documents released are emails appearing to be sent between FBI personnel in 2019 that mention 10 possible \"co-conspirators\" of Epstein. Another email sent to FBI New York gives an update on the co-conspirators. The email is presumably referring to Former Victoria's Secret CEO Les Wexner, who had a public friendship with Epstein. In 2019, Wexner said he was \"embarrassed\" by his ties to the financier. Lawyers for Wexner told BBC News that \"the assistant US attorney in charge of the Epstein investigation stated at the time that Mr Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target\". \"There's 10 co-conspirators, potentially, that we knew nothing about, that the DoJ had been investigating,\" Democratic Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told BBC News on Tuesday. The handwritten letter and envelope appeared to show Epstein writing to Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics doctor who is serving decades in prison for sexually abusing young female athletes. \"We shared one thing…our love & caring for young ladies and the hope they'd reach their full potential.\" The writer signs the letter off: \"Life is unfair, Yours, J Epstein.\" The letter had been deemed undeliverable, and was sent - apparently as a return - to the Manhattan jail in which Epstein was detained before his death in 2019. The released documents show that the FBI was alerted to the letter and requested an analysis of it. It was also postmarked on 13 August 2019, three days after Epstein died. The documents released on Tuesday also show the analysis request by the FBI. A FBI laboratory request stated that in August 2019, a sender listed as \"J Epstein\" at \"Manhattan Correctional\" tried to send a letter to \"Larry Nassar at 9300 S Wilmot Road, Tucson, Arizona, 85756\", the address of a federal prison. Among these files is an email from January 2020, in which a federal prosecutor in New York wrote that newly received flight records \"reflect that Donald Trump traveled on Epstein's private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware)\". Trump was listed as a passenger on \"at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996\", and Ghislaine Maxwell was present on at least four of those flights, the prosecutor wrote. Trump was previously married to Marla Maples, Tiffany's mother, from 1993 to 1999. The prosecutor also wrote that \"on one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old\", with the third passenger's name redacted. \"On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case.\" The timing of Trump's alleged trips coincide with the years that were examined by federal prosecutors for Maxwell's conduct and travels as part of the criminal case they brought against her. In a statement accompanying Tuesday's release, the DoJ said the new files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election\". The statement continued: \"To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.\" Fake video of Epstein included Among one of the odder entries in Tuesday's document drop was a fake video showing an Epstein-like figure in a prison cell. Other documents showed that a man from Florida sent an email to federal investigators in March 2021 with a link to the video. BBC Verify used a reverse image search to find a copy of the video had been uploaded to YouTube in October 2020. The user who posted it said the clip had been created using 3D graphics. According to a 2023 report by the Bureau of Prisons, no video recording from inside Epstein's cell on the day of his death exists.

      "summary_tr_long": "Rivalries and rumours: How the new order of the Murdoch dynasty is playing out Katie Razzall Culture and Media Editor BBC Listen to this article Christmas is a time when families get together if they can - and, until this year, the Murdochs were no different. With members of the media dynasty spread across the globe, full family gatherings were rare, although in 2008, according to biographer Michael Wolff, the Murdochs spent the festive season together on a flotilla of private yachts. WireImage Elisabeth Murdoch and two of her siblings, James and Prudence, have been cut out of the family firm Rupert's eldest child by his second wife, Elisabeth is the co-founder and executive chairman of the production company, Sister, which is behind hit television series, including Black Doves, The Split and This is Going To Hurt. Money doesn't compensate for a father who, in his mid-90s, decided to rip his family apart because he believed it was in the interests of his business. The Murdochs have never been a traditional family - one reason why their story is said to have inspired the power struggles and backstabbing in the acclaimed TV drama, Succession. And as one person put it to me, the TV show concluded too early by killing off Logan Roy: there was more drama to come. Earlier this year, he described his dad as a \"misogynist\" in an interview in US magazine The Atlantic, and referred to some of Rupert's behaviour in the courtroom fight as \"twisted\". Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images James Murdoch's relationship with his father Rupert and older brother Lachlan now appears irreconcilable (L-R, James Murdoch, Anna Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch) Lachlan, who Rupert had already chosen to run the business, is now - definitively - the only one who will take the reins after his father's demise. The trust had been set up in 1999, when Rupert divorced Anna, the mother of Lachlan, Elisabeth and James. Ironically, his successful leadership of Fox Corp, where he's been CEO since 2019 (he became chairman of Fox and also News Corp in 2023 when his father became chairman emeritus), made the deal more costly. Their father turned 94 in March, with the court battle in full swing. Fox Corp may operate out of the US, but he is said to prefer the laid-back nature of Australian life, even if the trade-off is business calls in the middle of the night because of the time difference, as well as a lot of flights. He's never going to want to say, 'Hey, that's me,' and so I think it's a little hard to come out from Dad's shadow.\" At the same time, Rodney Benson, professor of media, culture, and communication at New York University, says that while Rupert remains a presence in the company \"what's really unique about Lachlan's approach, or what will be unique about his approach, won't fully emerge\". In September, US President Donald Trump said Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch were expected to be part of a group of investors trying to buy TikTok in the US. On Thursday, TikTok parent company ByteDance announced to staff that it had signed an agreement to sell a portion of TikTok to a group of mostly US based investors. Reuters Under Lachlan Murdoch's leadership, the company has pursued a strategy centred on digital and streaming growth Presenting the Fox Corporation's results for July to September, Lachlan said Tubi had achieved rapid revenue growth and growth in view time, confirming its position as the top premium advertising-based video-on-demand platform in the US. Rupert Murdoch's 70-year career saw him as \"both an interventionist editor-in-chief figure and a political kingmaker\", according to Paddy Manning, an investigative journalist who wrote The Successor: The High-Stakes Life of Lachlan Murdoch. From digital real estate to sports betting to commercial radio to Tubi, Lachlan's investment decisions are focused on the bottom line, not burnishing his political credentials.\" But Prof Benson suggests the significant debt the Murdoch businesses have taken on as part of the settlement with Lachlan's siblings increases pressure to make profit, and therefore to pursue \"politically sensationalistic… outrage journalism\". I'm told he spent nearly two weeks in London and was in the News UK office most days. Rupert's been described to me, at 94, as still \"the sharpest person in the room\" and a \"phenomenon who loves papers and has ink in his veins\".

Presciently, Anna Murdoch - Lachlan, James and Elisabeth's mother - predicted much of the fallout back in the 1980s. Getty Images Anna Murdoch, the mother of Lachlan, James and Elisabeth, warned that family divisions could emerge (L - R, Lachlan, James, Rupert, Elisabeth and Anna) A decade after it was published - by which time the pair had divorced and Rupert had married third wife Wendi Deng - Anna gave an interview to an Australian women's magazine, during which she was asked which of her children would be best suited to take over from her ex-husband.

      "summary_tr_long": "Lebo Diseko Global Religion correspondent Getty Images Pope Leo has criticised the Trump administration's immigration policy Jesse Romero, a conservative Catholic podcaster, has some choice words for Pope Leo XIV. \"He has no authority over the government; he has to stay in his lane.\" As a Donald Trump supporter, he is angry about criticism made by the American-born Pope and US bishops about his mass deportation policy. Catholics like Vice President JD Vance, and influential legal activist Leonard Leo, were an important part of Donald Trump's electoral success. Instead, Pope Leo XIV has spoken repeatedly about his concerns over how migrants are treated in the US, calling for \"deep reflection\" on the matter in November. The pontiff evoked the gospel of Matthew, adding that \"Jesus says very clearly, at the end of the world, we're going to be asked, 'How did you receive the foreigner?\" A week later the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), issued a rare \"Special Message\" voicing their \"concern for the evolving situation impacting immigrants in the United States\". It was a significant intervention, the first time the USCCB had used such a communique in a dozen years. Getty Images Chicago has been a focus of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement Picking a fight with the Pope \"I think the relationship is quite tense,\" says David Gibson, director of Fordham University's Center on Religion and Culture. Conservatives had hoped that Pope Leo would bring a change from his predecessor Pope Francis's focus on issues of social justice and migration, according to Gibson. White House border czar, Tom Homan - himself a Catholic - has said that the Church \"is wrong\", and that its leaders \"need to spend time fixing the Catholic Church\". And in October, the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected the Chicago born Pope's suggestion that US treatment of immigrants was \"inhuman\" and not in line with \"pro-life\" beliefs. Gibson argues that the government's calculation \"is that there are enough American Catholics, especially white American Catholics, who support the Republican Party and Donald Trump, that it's politically beneficial at the end of the day to pick a fight with the Pope. That's an unprecedented calculus.\" Nearly 60% of white Catholics approve of how Trump is handling immigration, according to a new study by the think tank the Public Religion Research Institute. That figure is around 30% for Hispanics, who are 37% of the US Catholic population. Getty Images US Vice President JD Vance has been vocal about how his Catholic faith has influenced his politics The growing power and prominence of right-wing Catholics in the political sphere is exemplified by JD Vance, a convert to the religion who says his politics are shaped by his faith. Although he has argued that current policy is not at odds with Church teaching, he has also said that there is a responsibility to remember the humanity of people who are in the country illegally. In November, Ms Rattenbury took part in a 2,000 strong celebration of Mass outside an ICE detention centre in the Broadview neighbourhood of Chicago. The \"People's Mass\" was one of a series of actions by the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership (CSPL). The CSPL has now filed a federal lawsuit alleging it was blocked from providing religious ministry. St Susanna Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, replaced baby Jesus with a hand-painted notice saying \"ICE was here\". Some in the community have complained, and the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston ordered that the display be removed, saying it was divisive and contravened rules on sacred objects. While many US Catholics maintain conservative positions on issues such as abortion, in line with that of the Church, they are also more likely to see themselves as progressive than white evangelical Christians, who overwhelmingly voted Republican in the last three elections. And nearly a third of Catholics in the US were born in other countries. \"The Catholic brand in the United States is an immigrant church.\" Getty Images Clergy say they have been blocked from giving Eucharist to migrants at an Illinois detention facility 'Inconsistent with the Gospel' Bishop Joseph Tyson of Yakima, Washington State, was one of the 216 who supported the USCCB's Special Message. \"We see a lot more positives in those immigrants.\" He says he is not arguing for open borders, a point that Pope Leo has also made, but is against \"indiscriminate deportation\". He estimates that around half of the families in his predominantly Hispanic diocese have someone in their household facing some sort of issue with their immigration status. Bishop Tyson says that more than a third of clergy he has ordained have at some point been on a temporary visa before gaining a green card, a process that in the current climate can feel precarious. He's on a T-visa, but [ICE] showed up, and he was afraid that he was going to be picked up,\" he said. \"Anybody can have their paperwork revoked, [so] we have our men carrying their papers with them at all times.\" Bishop Tyson argues that current US policy goes against Catholic teaching. It is inconsistent with the Gospel of Life.\" For Jesse Romero though, it is US bishops and the Pope who are going against Catholic doctrine. He argues the Catechism - which summarises the teachings of the Church - is clear that immigrants should keep to all laws, including those about whether they should be in the country. \"We have a large swath of bishops in the Catholic Church of America that have a more modernist, liberal, progressive view of Scripture and theology.\" Romero says he prays for their conversion.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Crisis in India-Bangladesh relations spirals amid violent protests Anbarasan Ethirajan Global affairs correspondent NurPhoto via Getty Images Protests erupted in India over the killing of a Hindu garment worker in Bangladesh The killing of a Hindu man during recent violent protests in Bangladesh has pushed already strained ties between Dhaka and Delhi into a deeper crisis. As the two neighbours accuse each other of destabilising relations, questions are growing over whether their once close, time-tested relationship is fraying beyond repair. The man who was killed - Dipu Chandra Das, 27 - a member of Bangladesh's Hindu minority, was accused of blasphemy and beaten to death by a mob last week in Mymensingh, in northern Bangladesh. The incident happened hours before violent protests broke out over the murder of Sharif Osman Hadi , a prominent student leader, in the capital, Dhaka. Hadi's supporters alleged that the main suspect, who they say is linked to the Awami League - the party of deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina - had fled to India, further fuelling anti-India sentiment in Muslim-majority Bangladesh. In recent days, the South Asian neighbours have suspended visa services in several cities, including Delhi, and accused each other of failing to ensure adequate security for their diplomatic missions. \"I sincerely hope tensions don't escalate further on both sides,\" Riva Ganguly Das, a former Indian high commissioner to Dhaka, told the BBC, adding that the \"volatile situation\" in Bangladesh made it difficult to predict which way things would go. Getty Images Graffiti in Dhaka, painted in memory of Sharif Osman Hadi who died of gunshot injuries Anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh is not new. A section of Bangladeshis has always resented what they see as India's overbearing influence on their country, especially during Hasina's 15-year rule before she was deposed in an uprising last year. The anger has grown since Hasina took refuge in India and Delhi, so far, hasn't agreed to send her back despite several requests from Dhaka. Police later detained 12 people in connection with the incident, but they were released later without any charge. \"I have not seen this kind of suspicion and mistrust between the two sides before,\" Humayun Kabir, a former senior Bangladeshi diplomat, said. AFP via Getty Images A silent protest in Bangladesh to condemn the killing of Dipu Chandra Das Some readers may find the details below disturbing. Bangladesh's interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, said there was \"no place for such violence in the new Bangladesh\", promising that no one involved in the killing would be spared. Bangladeshi police say they have arrested 12 people in connection with the killing of Das. Analysts say his killing has once again raised questions over the safety of minorities and civil society activists in Bangladesh, with religious fundamentalists becoming more assertive and intolerant after Hasina's exit. Radical Islamists have desecrated hundreds of Sufi shrines, attacked Hindus, prevented women from playing football in some areas and have also curtailed music and cultural shows. \"Hardline elements of society now see themselves as the mainstream, and they don't want to see pluralism or diversity of thought in the country,\" Asif Bin Ali, a Bangladeshi political analyst, said. That gives a green light to others on the ground to attack them.\" Many in Bangladesh suspect Islamist radicals to be part of the mob that vandalised and set fire to the buildings of two Bangladesh dailies - The Daily Star and Prothom Alo - and a cultural institution last week, accusing them of being pro-India. Even before the protests, the interim government was under scrutiny as it struggled to maintain law and order and deliver results amid the political turmoil. Experts like Ashok Swain argue that right-wing leaders on both sides are making provocative statements for their own benefit, inflaming tension and public anger. \"A large section of the Indian media is also playing up events in Bangladesh and portraying that the country is descending into communal chaos,\" says Mr Swain, a professor of peace and conflict research at Uppsala University in Sweden. With the interim administration in Dhaka facing criticism over its lack of control and legitimacy, there is broad consensus that an elected government would be better positioned to address Bangladesh's domestic and foreign challenges. The country is scheduled to hold elections on 12 February but until then, Yunus has the difficult task of avoiding further violence. Getty Images Police blocked a protest march to the Indian high commission in Dhaka last week With Ms Hasina's Awami League banned from taking part in the polls, it's widely expected that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) will emerge as the winner. But Islamist political parties like the Jamaat-e-Islami can pose a challenge to the BNP. There are worries that there could be more violence in the coming days as hardline religious parties exploit anti-India sentiments. \"The biggest victim of this anti-India politics is not India, it's Bangladeshi citizens themselves – like secular minded individuals, centrists and minorities,\" warns Asif Bin Ali. He says the current narrative shows that anyone or any institution who criticises fundamentalists can be \"dehumanised by labelling them pro-India, and attacks on them can be justified\". An Indian parliamentary panel said developments in Bangladesh pose \"the greatest strategic challenge\" to Delhi since the country's independence war in 1971. Former Bangladeshi diplomats like Humayun Kabir feel that India should accept the ground reality and reach out to Bangladesh to rebuild trust. Delhi has already indicated that it will engage with an elected government in Bangladesh and that could pave the way for a diplomatic reboot.",

      "summary_tr_long": "An alleged drug cartel and a murdered witness: South Africa's police corruption probe Khanyisile Ngcobo Johannesburg Gallo Images via Getty Images Senzo Mchunu was suspended as police minister after corruption allegations emerged about him, which he denies South Africans have long suspected corruption and political interference were at work in the police force but in the past few months allegations appearing to confirm this have been aired in two public inquiries. Lt-Gen Mkhwanazi, who heads up the police in KwaZulu-Natal province, claimed that Mchunu had ties to crime kingpins and this was why he shut down an elite unit investigating political murders. Mchunu, a senior member of Ramaphosa's African National Congress (ANC) and a close ally of the president, has denied any wrongdoing. In the three months of testimony from the parallel inquiries, South Africans have heard about an alleged drug cartel with political connections and a businessman, who is awaiting trial for attempted murder, with alleged ties to leading government figures. Here's what we've learned so far: Role of the 'Big Five Cartel' Among the most explosive evidence was the testimony given by police crime intelligence boss Lt-Gen Dumisani Khumalo. Appearing before the Madlanga Commission within the first month of hearings, Lt-Gen Khumalo alleged there was a drug trafficking cartel, headed by individuals who he called the Big Five, operating in several provinces, which had \"penetrated the political sphere\". Mr Matlala is currently facing 25 criminal charges, among them attempted murder. These stem from three separate incidents that occurred between 2022 and 2024. He alleged that it was a cartel, that was operating both locally and abroad, and dealt mainly with narcotics but also carried out contract killings \"associated with the drug trafficking processes\", cross-border hijackings and kidnappings. This cartel had tentacles within the country's criminal justice system, and this allowed them to \"manipulate investigations, suppress evidence [and] obstruct legal proceedings that threaten their activities\", Lt-Gen Khumalo added. It was this grouping that was allegedly behind the disbandment of the political killings task team (PKTT), which was working mainly in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. This is because the cartel \"mistakenly thought the PKTT was investigating\" them, Lt-Gen Khumalo told the commission. Another witness at the Madlanga Commission had been part of the PKTT. Gallo Images via Getty Images Vusimusi \"Cat\" Matlala spent two days giving testimony at the parliamentary inquiry Central to the allegations against the suspended police minister is his alleged close relationship with \"Cat\" Matlala. At the Madlanga Commission, Mkhwanazi repeated claims he had made at a press conference in July that Mchunu was indirectly receiving financial support from the businessman to fund his \"political endeavours\". \"This is the first time I get accused of such.\" Mr Matlala had a lucrative contract with the police before it was abruptly cancelled when he was charged for attempted murder in May. In 2001, he was convicted and served time for the possession of stolen goods. Over the years, he would be arrested for a string of alleged crimes, including house robberies, a cash-in-transit heist and assault, but in all cases he denied involvement and was either acquitted or had the charges withdrawn against him. Appearing at the parliamentary inquiry, Mr Matlala said he had turned his life around in 2017, when he \"formally registered my first business which was a security business\". Over the course of his two-day testimony in front of MPs Mr Matlala laid bare his description of relationships with former and current ministers as well as top police officials. He denied knowing the senior police officers and politicians personally but admitted making payments for ANC-related activities. He also told the parliamentary panel that after the authorities had returned firearms seized from him, former Police Minister Bheki Cele had demanded \"a facilitation fee\" of 1m rand ($60,000; £45,000) to which he only paid half the amount. Cele, who testified before Mr Matlala's appearance at the parliamentary committee, admitted to MPs that he had known Mr Matlala for a couple of months and had stayed at his penthouse on two occasions as these were \"freebies\". Witness C told the Madlanga Commission that Mr Matlala had \"close relationships with senior [police] officials\" and had detailed the extent of this after police arrested him back in May. The witness alleged that Mr Matlala contributed money towards the now-suspended police minister's presidential ambitions within the ANC even though he did not believe he would win. In his appearance in front of Judge Madlanga he had implicated officials, including Brig Julius Mkhwanazi (no relation to Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi) who was acting police chief for an area including parts of Johannesburg. Gallo via Getty Images Retired Judge Mbuyiseli Madlanga will chair further sessions in the new year and will then submit a final report There he had claimed Brig Mkhwanazi ordered him to get rid of the body of a man accused of robbery who had allegedly been tortured and killed by police officials. The targeting of whistleblowers has become common in the country, with rights groups like Human Rights Watch noting that \"many face retaliation, loss of livelihood and even loss of life\". \"The commissioner will [however] advise the president on areas that are of national security sensitivity and how those areas will need to be managed,\" he added in a briefing to journalists. The Madlanga Commission was given six months to complete its work and submit a final report, but this can be extended as the \"president may determine\", according to its terms of reference. It is not clear how long the parliamentary inquiry will run but it too is expected to resume hearings in 2026. More BBC stories on South Africa: Getty Images/BBC",

      "summary_tr_long": "TikTok removes AI weight loss ads from fake Boots account Jamie Ryan BBC Social News BBC Some of the posts falsely claiming to be from Boots, using the store's logo Fake adverts for weight loss drugs by a company pretending to be health and beauty retailer Boots have been removed from TikTok after the firm complained. The adverts for prescription-only weight loss drugs appeared to show smiling healthcare professionals from the British retailer - but in reality they were made with AI. It is illegal to advertise prescription-only weight loss drugs to the public. A spokesperson for Boots told the BBC the firm was \"aware\" of the videos and had complained to TikTok, which said it had removed the videos. A TikTok spokesperson said it did not allow \"harmful or misleading AI-generated ads\" on its platform. But the BBC found while the videos were removed, the account - seemingly located in Hong Kong - was not. It was able to re-upload the exact same videos despite the originals being removed. TikTok was again notified of this, and the user was subsequently deleted. Weight-loss jabs have been available on the NHS in England since the end of June, but they are not available over-the-counter and patients must meet strict criteria in order to be eligible for a prescription. Before the fake Boots account was removed, its videos linked to a website where weight loss drugs could be bought. It featured testimonies from customers and doctors which were either made with AI or taken from other websites. The TikTok videos showed what appeared to be health workers drinking from a vial of blue liquid. This would then appear to jump forward several months, with the workers apparently having lost a drastic amount of weight. \"AI now makes it trivially easy to generate a convincing series of videos or images showing an apparent change in a plausibly real generic health professional, or to impersonate specific health professionals wholesale,\" AI expert Sam Gregory told the BBC. \"The underlying question is how quickly and comprehensively platforms act when they detect - or are notified of - scams that clearly breach their terms of service. \"Major brands like Boots will get prioritised over an individual business owner who's been targeted.\" 'Serious risks' to health Other videos uploaded by the same account on TikTok seemed to have used content originally posted by real people, showcasing their weight-loss journey, but repurposed and used without permission. All of the videos used similar branding and names to that of the official Boots account on TikTok - using the handle \"@BootsOfficial\". Boots said it only runs adverts on social media through its actual account @BootsUK. The website also included warnings from the MHRA, the UK's governmental body that ensures medicines and medical devices are safe, about purchasing counterfeit products. A spokesperson for the body told the BBC weight loss medicines \"should only be obtained from a registered pharmacy against a prescription issued by a healthcare professional\". \"Taking these medicines sourced in any other way carries serious risks to your health with no guarantees about what they contain,\" they said. TikTok said it would continue to \"strengthen\" its detection methods for AI-generated content and it does not allow \"the depiction, promotion, or trade of controlled substances\".",

In 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Activision, which publishes the Call of Duty games, and the pair were subsequently locked in a long dispute with the company which they settled out of court in 2012.",
      "summary_tr_long": "Vince Zampella, who co-created the popular video game series Call of Duty, has died in a car crash in California, aged 55. Zampella's death was confirmed by Electronic Arts, which owns Respawn Entertainment, a game studio he co-founded. The influential video game developer was travelling in a Ferrari with another person, when it crashed and caught fire on a highway in Los Angeles on Sunday. \"This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince's family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work,\" a spokesperson for Electronic Arts told the BBC. Officials said the person on the vehicle's passenger seat was ejected while the driver remained trapped. It is unclear if Zampella was driving the car and who the other person inside was. \"For unknown reasons, the vehicle veered off the roadway, struck a concrete barrier, and became fully engulfed,\" the California Highway Patrol said in a statement to the BBC. Zampella created Call of Duty with his long time collaborators Jason West and Grant Collier in 2003. Partly inspired by events in World War II, the game has sold more than 500 million copies making owners Microsoft's Activision one of the most profitable gaming companies. It has also spawned an upcoming live-action film. The Call of Duty franchise was not his only success. He was also behind other widely popular games including the Medal of Honor, Titanfall and Apex Legends. Journalist and Game Awards host Geoff Keighley, who wrote a book about the making of Titanfall , called Zampella a \"dear friend\" in a post on X and a \"visionary executive\" who \"never wavered in his commitment to honesty and transparency\". \"While he created some of the most influential games of our time, I always felt he still had his greatest one ahead of him,\" he said. \"It's heartbreaking that we'll never get to play it.\" \"He really cared about the player experience,\" Keza MacDonald, the Guardian's video games editor, told BBC Newshour. \"He cared about making games, he cared about how people felt when they played and that really came across whenever you spoke to him.\" YouTuber MrRoflWaffles, whose Call of Duty videos have amassed him more than 2.4 million subscribers, credited the developer for inspiring \"a whole generation\" with the franchise, including his own content. \"You talk about the Mount Rushmore of gaming - he's absolutely staple on that list of people,\" he told BBC Newsbeat. In 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Activision, which publishes the Call of Duty games, and the pair were subsequently locked in a long dispute with the company which they settled out of court in 2012. At Electronic Arts, Zampella worked on Battlefield 6, which is seen as a direct competitor to Call of Duty. Infinity Ward, the American company that developed Call of Duty, said Zampella \"will always have a special place in our history\". \"Your legacy of creating iconic, lasting entertainment is immeasurable,\" the company said in a statement on X.",

North Koreans tried to apply for remote working IT jobs using stolen or fake identities, Amazon's chief security officer Stephen Schmidt said in a LinkedIn post. \"Their objective is typically straightforward: get hired, get paid, and funnel wages back to fund the regime's weapons programs,\" he said, adding that this trend is likely to be happening at scale across the industry, especially in the US. Authorities in the US and South Korea have warned about Pyongyang's operatives carrying out online scams. Amazon has seen a nearly one-third increase in job applications from North Koreans in the past year, said Mr Schmidt in his post . He said the operatives typically work with people managing \"laptop farms\" - referring to computers based in the US that are run remotely from outside of the country. The firm used a combination of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and verification by its staff to screen job applications, he said. The strategies used by such fraudsters have become more sophisticated, Mr Schmidt said. Bad actors are hijacking dormant LinkedIn accounts using leaked credentials to gain verification. They target genuine software engineers to appear credible, he said, urging firms to report suspicious job applications to the authorities. Mr Schmidt warned employers to look out for indicators of fraudulent North Korean job applications, including incorrectly formatted phone numbers and mismatched education histories. In June, the US government said it had uncovered 29 \"laptop farms\" that were being operated illegally across the country by North Korean IT workers. They used stolen or forged identities of Americans to help North Korean nationals get jobs in the US, said the Department of Justice (DOJ). It also indicted US brokers who had helped secure jobs for the North Korean operatives. In July, a woman from Arizona was sentenced to more than eight years in jail for running a laptop farm to help North Korean IT workers secure remote jobs at more than 300 US companies. The DOJ said the scheme generated more than $17m (£12.6m) in illicit gains for her and Pyongyang.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Uber and Lyft announce plans to trial Chinese robotaxis in UK in 2026 Liv McMahon Technology reporter Bloomberg via Getty Images Baidu's driverless Apollo Go taxis are already on roads in China, Hong Kong and Dubai Chinese robotaxis could be set to hit UK roads in 2026 as ride-sharing apps Uber and Lyft announce partnerships with Baidu to trial the tech. The two companies are hoping to obtain approval from regulators to test the autonomous vehicles in London. Baidu's Apollo Go driverless taxi service already operates in dozens of cities, mostly in China, and has accrued millions of rides without a human behind the wheel. Transport secretary Heidi Alexander said the news was \"another vote of confidence in our plans for self-driving vehicles\" - but many remain sceptical about their safety. \"We're planning for self-driving cars to carry passengers for the first time from spring, under our pilot scheme – harnessing this technology safely and responsibly to transform travel,\" Ms Alexander said in a post on X . Uber said in June it would bring its plans to trial UK driverless cars forward as the government sought to accelerate framework to allow pilots of small autonomous \"bus and taxi like\" commercial services in 2026. \"We're excited to accelerate Britain's leadership in the future of mobility, bringing another safe and reliable travel option to Londoners next year,\" it said of its Baidu partnership on Monday. Lyft said in August it would look to deploy driverless taxis in the UK and Germany as part of a European agreement with Baidu. It already operates \"autonomous rides\" in Atlanta, US - where Uber also operates a robotaxi service through its partnership with Waymo. Lyft chief executive David Risher said in a post on X on Monday London passengers would be \"the first in the region to experience Baidu's Apollo Go vehicles\". But both firms still need to convince regulators. Mr Risher said if green lit, Lyft's initial fleet of dozens of Baidu Apollo Go cars would begin testing next year \"with plans to scale to hundreds from there\". But Jack Stilgoe, professor of science and technology policy at University College London, said driverless cars \"can't just scale up like other digital technologies\". \"There's a big difference between having a few test vehicles using public streets as their laboratory and a fully-developed, scaled-up system that becomes a real transport option for people,\" he told the BBC. Congestion concerns Self-driving vehicles have often been lauded as the future of transport, with some claiming they make fewer errors than human drivers. But many people remain uneasy about the safety of taxis without a human operator. Almost 60% of UK respondents to a YouGov poll in October said they would not feel comfortable riding in a driverless taxi under any circumstances. Many also expressed a lack of trust in the tech, with 85% saying they would opt for a cab with a human driver if given the same price and convenience. Instances of autonomous vehicles making mistakes, trapping passengers in cars and causing traffic jams or accidents also continue to make headlines. Self-driving taxi operator Waymo reportedly suspended its service in San Francisco on Saturday after some of its vehicles stopped working during a power cut. Prof Stilgoe said amid concerns about their safety, as well as privacy and the potential to add to congestion, the UK should lead in \"setting standards for the technology\". \"London has been really successful at getting cars out of its city centre,\" he said. \"When it comes to traffic, the only thing worse than a single-occupancy car is a zero-occupancy one.\"",

      "summary_tr_long": "Will the US TikTok deal make it safer but less relevant? Laura Cress, Technology reporter and Lily Jamali, North America technology correspondent, San Francisco Getty Images TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance has signed a deal with investors to run its business in the US. But what does this mean for the over 170 million Americans (or so the social media platform claims) who use the app? The key may lie in how TikTok's recommendation algorithm - the powerful system that curates the platform's For You Page to predict content you might watch - is managed when it changes hands. Social media industry expert Matt Navarra told the BBC the question will not be whether TikTok survives, but \"what version of TikTok survives\". 'Smoothing out the edges' Currently, TikTok's system depends on huge amounts of global data and feedback loops, which can change recommendations in an instant. Under the terms of the deal TikTok's algorithm, which will be licensed by investor Oracle, is set to be retrained on American user data. Mr Navarra said this could leave the app feeling \"safer and sturdier\" but also leaving it at a risk of \"becoming less culturally essential\" as a result. \"TikTok's power has always come from feeling slightly out of control - weird, niche, uncomfortable, sometimes politically sharp content for anyone else or before it goes anywhere else,\" he said. \"If you start smoothing those edges, you don't just change moderation. I think you change its relevance.\" Matching ByteDance's algorithm Whether the US version will differ from the TikTok so many know and use already may also depend on if it gets \"all the new features, security updates and platform improvements\" as soon as the international version does, tech journalist Will Guyatt told the BBC. And computing expert Kokil Jaidka from the National University of Singapore said she expected the things that make the platform popular - such as its short videos and shopping - are likely to \"stay intact\" as these features are not dependent on the algorithm. She said the changes might be more subtle and gradual, depending on if the narrower data inputs of the \"siloed\" US version can match the app's global reach. \"If TikTok is operating with a licensed or partially diluted version of its recommendation algorithm, some of the system's blind spots may start to matter more,\" she said. For users, she said this means in practice the US algorithm may \"lag in personalisation\" and take longer to adapt to viral content. Oracle is TikTok's longtime cloud computing partner in the United States, and is chaired by Larry Ellison, an ally of President Trump. Another foreign entity, MGX - an Abu-Dhabi government investment fund - will join it along with private equity firm Silver Lake as the main incoming investors. Pressure from these investors may also add to the US app feeling \"blander\" said Mr Navarra. \"I think the real test won't be whether the users leave,\" he said. \"It will be whether TikTok still feels the place the internet goes to experiment - or if it becomes the place it goes to behave.\" Additional reporting by Peter Hoskins.",

      "summary_tr_long": "TikTok owner signs deal to avoid US ban Peter Hoskins, business reporter and Lily Jamali, North America technology correspondent Watch: What does TikTok's deal mean for America's users? TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance has signed binding agreements with American and global investors to operate its business in the US, the video platform's boss told employees on Thursday. Half of the joint venture will be owned by a group of investors including Oracle, Silver Lake and the Emirati investment firm MGX, according to a memo sent by chief executive Shou Zi Chew. The deal, which is set to close on 22 January, would end years of efforts by Washington to force ByteDance to sell its US operations over national security concerns. It is in ​line with a deal unveiled in September, when US President Donald Trump delayed the enforcement of a law that would ban the app unless it was sold. TikTok said in the memo that the deal would enable \"over 170 million Americans to continue discovering a world of endless possibilities as part of a vital global community\". Under the agreement, ByteDance will retain 19.9% of the business, while Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will hold 15% each. Another 30.1% will be held by affiliates of existing ByteDance investors, according to the memo. The White House previously said that Oracle, which was co-founded by Trump supporter Larry Ellison, will license TikTok's recommendation algorithm as part of the deal. The deal comes after a series of delays. In April 2024, during President Joe Biden's administration, the US Congress passed a law to ban the app over national security concerns, unless it was sold. The law was set to go into effect on 20 January 2025 but was pushed back multiple times by Trump while his administration worked out a deal to transfer ownership. Trump said in September that he had spoken on the phone to China's President Xi Jinping, who he said had given the deal the go-ahead. The platform's future remained unclear after the leaders met face-to-face in October. The app's fate was clouded by ongoing tensions between the two nations on other matters including trade. \"TikTok has become a bargaining chip in the wider US-China relationship,\" said Alvin Graylin, a lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"With recent softening tensions, Beijing's sign-off on the structure and algorithm licensing now looks less like capitulation and more like calibrated de-escalation, letting both capitals claim a win at home.\" The White House referred the BBC to TikTok when contacted for comment. Oracle and Silver Lake declined to comment. The deal drew critiques from Senate Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon, who said it would not do \"a thing to protect the privacy of American user\". Under the terms, TikTok's recommendation algorithm is set to be retrained on US user data to ensure feeds are free from external manipulation. \"It's unclear that it will even put TikTok's algorithm in safer hands,\" said Wyden. He opposed the 2024 law and was among US lawmakers who lobbied to extend the TikTok deadline in January in a bid to give Congress more time to mitigate threats from China. Some users also expressed caution at the prospect of new investors. Small business owner Tiffany Cianci, who has more than 300,000 followers and nearly four million likes on the platform, said she hopes the incoming investors will maintain the same user experience for entrepreneurs like her. \"I hope small business owners are protected,\" she said. TikTok has said that more than seven million small businesses market their products and services on TikTok in the US. \"I reserve judgement on whether or not we have saved the app for those small businesses,\" Ms Cianci said. She added that she chose TikTok for promotion because the platform offered profit-sharing on terms that are more favourable than what competitors like Meta offered. Over the last year, Ms Cianci has been active in organising protests in Washington and on TikTok aimed at saving the app.",

      "summary_tr_long": "UK to ban deepfake AI 'nudification' apps Liv McMahon Technology reporter Getty Images The UK government says it will ban so-called \"nudification\" apps as part of efforts to tackle misogyny online. New laws - announced on Thursday as part of a wider strategy to halve violence against women and girls - will make it illegal to create and supply AI tools letting users edit images to seemingly remove someone's clothing. The new offences would build on existing rules around sexually explicit deepfakes and intimate image abuse, the government said. \"Women and girls deserve to be safe online as well as offline,\" said Technology Secretary Liz Kendall. \"We will not stand by while technology is weaponised to abuse, humiliate and exploit them through the creation of non-consensual sexually explicit deepfakes.\" Creating deepfake explicit images of someone without their consent is already a criminal offence under the Online Safety Act. Ms Kendall said the new offence - which makes it illegal to create or distribute nudifying apps - would mean \"those who profit from them or enable their use will feel the full force of the law\". Nudification or \"de-clothing\" apps use generative AI to realistically make it look like a person has been stripped of their clothing in an image or video. Experts have issued warnings about the rise of such apps and the potential for fake nude imagery to inflict serious harm on victims - particularly when used to create child sexual abuse material (CSAM). In April, the Children's Commissioner for England Dame Rachel de Souza called for a total ban on nudification apps . \"The act of making such an image is rightly illegal – the technology enabling it should also be,\" she said in a report . The government said on Thursday it would \"join forces with tech companies\" to develop methods to combat intimate image abuse. This would include continuing its work with UK safety tech firm SafeToNet, it said. The UK company developed AI software it claimed could identify and block sexual content, as well as block cameras when they detect sexual content is being captured. Such tech builds on existing filters implemented by platforms such as Meta to detect and flag potential nudity in imagery, often with the aim of stopping children taking or sharing intimate images of themselves. 'No reason to exist' Plans to ban nudifying apps come after previous calls from child protection charities for the government to crack down on the tech. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) - whose Report Remove helpline allows under-18s to confidentially report explicit images of themselves online - said 19% of confirmed reporters had said some or all of their imagery had been manipulated. Its chief executive Kerry Smith welcomed the measures. \"We are also glad to see concrete steps to ban these so-called nudification apps which have no reason to exist as a product,\" she said. \"Apps like this put real children at even greater risk of harm, and we see the imagery produced being harvested in some of the darkest corners of the internet.\" However while children's charity the NSPCC welcomed the news, its director of strategy Dr Maria Neophytou said it was \"disappointed\" to not see similar \"ambition\" to introduce mandatory device-level protections. The charity is among organisations calling on the government to make tech firms find easier ways to identify and prevent spread of CSAM on their services, such as in private messages. The government said on Thursday it would make it \"impossible\" for children to take, share or view a nude image on their phones. It is also seeking to outlaw AI tools designed to create or distribute CSAM .",

      "summary_tr_long": "£100 contactless card limit to be lifted Kevin Peachey Cost of living correspondent Convenient or dangerous? Shoppers react to contactless card limit lift announcement Millions of people will be able to set their own contactless card payment limits or even have no limit at all, a regulator has confirmed. Banks and card providers will be given the power, from March, to set a maximum - or unlimited - single payment amount without the need to enter a four-digit PIN. But they are also being encouraged by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to allow cardholders to set their own individual limits, or switch off contactless entirely. The move comes despite the FCA's own survey showing little appetite among consumers and industry respondents for a change from the current £100 limit on contactless cards. The FCA said it did not expect card providers to make immediate changes to the current limit from March, but they had the flexibility to do so. When contactless card payments were introduced in 2007, the transaction limit was set at £10. The limit was raised gradually, to £15 in 2010, to £20 in 2012, then to £30 in 2015, before the Covid pandemic prompted a jump to £45 in 2020, then to £100 in October 2021. While contactless cards currently have a £100 payment limit, anyone using their smartphone to pay can spend any amount without the need for a PIN. In-built security features, such as thumbprints and face ID, provide greater protection. But concerns have been raised about cards becoming more attractive to thieves and fraudsters, when high-value payments can be made with a tap of a card. Various protections are already in place, such as a prompt to enter a PIN after a series of consecutive contactless transactions are made. Consumers would still get their money back if it was stolen by fraudsters, according to David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA. \"Contactless is people's favoured way to pay,\" he said. Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Mr Geale said while the system works well, rigid limits could \"slow things down\". \"So what we want to do is give banks and payment firms greater flexibility to set their own approach to contactless payment, where they see low risk of fraud,\" he said. In practice, he said that means banks and payment companies could choose a limit based on their customers. \"But what we're really encouraging is that they'll open up that flexibility for customers to set their own limits,\" he added. Other countries, such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand allow industry to set contactless card limits. Jana Mackintosh, managing director of payments and innovation at UK Finance, which represents banks, said: \"Any changes made in the future will be done carefully and ensure strong security and fraud controls remain in place.\" Getty Images Temptation to spend? The FCA's own survey on changing the rules, released during consultation, showed that 78% of consumers who responded said they did not want any change to the current limits. Consumers and academics have suggested that the extra convenience of unlimited contactless payment limits could also lead to shoppers spending without thinking . This is said to be a particular issue with credit cards, when people are spending borrowed money and accumulating debt. Financial abuse charities have also warned that unlimited contactless spending could give abusers free access to drain a survivor's bank account with no checks or alerts. They also worry it could also hasten the shift towards a cashless society, despite notes and coins being a lifeline to many financial abuse survivors whose card transactions are monitored online by their abusers. One policy to help vulnerable customers access cash, as bank branches close, is the development of shared banking hubs. Cash Access UK, the organisation set up to protect access to cash across the UK, announced the official opening of its 200th banking hub in Billericay, Essex, on Friday.

      "summary_tr_long": "One in three using AI for emotional support and conversation, UK says Chris Vallance Senior technology reporter Getty Images One in three adults in the UK are using artificial intelligence (AI) for emotional support or social interaction, according to research published by a government body. And one in 25 people turned to the tech for support or conversation every day, the AI Security Institute (AISI) said in its first report . The report is based on two years of testing the abilities of more than 30 unnamed advanced AIs - covering areas critical to security, including cyber skills, chemistry and biology. The government said AISI's work would support its future plans by helping companies fix problems \"before their AI systems are widely used\". A survey by AISI of over 2,000 UK adults found people were primarily using chatbots like ChatGPT for emotional support or social interaction, followed by voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa. Researchers also analysed what happened to an online community of more than two million Reddit users dedicated to discussing AI companions, when the tech failed. The researchers found when the chatbots went down, people reported self-described \"symptoms of withdrawal\", such as feeling anxious or depressed - as well as having disrupted sleep or neglecting their responsibilities. Doubling cyber skills As well as the emotional impact of AI use, AISI researchers looked at other risks caused by the tech's accelerating capabilities. There is considerable concern about AI enabling cyber attacks, but equally it can be used to help secure systems from hackers. Its ability to spot and exploit security flaws was in some cases \"doubling every eight months\", the report suggests. And AI systems were also beginning to complete expert-level cyber tasks which would typically require over 10 years of experience. Researchers also found the tech's impact in science was also growing rapidly. In 2025, AI models had \"long since exceeded human biology experts with PhDs - with performance in chemistry quickly catching up\". 'Humans losing control' From novels such as Isaac Asimov's I, Robot to modern video games like Horizon: Zero Dawn, sci-fi has long imagined what would happen if AI broke free of human control. Now, according to the report, the \"worst-case scenario\" of humans losing control of advanced AI systems is \"taken seriously by many experts\". AI models are increasingly exhibiting some of the capabilities required to self-replicate across the internet, controlled lab tests suggested. AISI examined whether models could carry out simple versions of tasks needed in the early stages of self-replication - such as \"passing know-your customer checks required to access financial services\" in order to successfully purchase the computing on which their copies would run. But the research found to be able to do this in the real world, AI systems would need to complete several such actions in sequence \"while remaining undetected\", something its research suggests they currently lack the capacity to do. Institute experts also looked at the possibility of models \"sandbagging\" - or strategically hiding their true capabilities from testers. They found tests showed it was possible, but there was no evidence of this type of subterfuge taking place. In May, AI firm Anthropic released a controversial report which described how an AI model was capable of seemingly blackmail-like behaviour if it thought its \"self-preservation\" was threatened. The threat from rogue AI is, however, a source of profound disagreement among leading researchers - many of whom feel it is exaggerated . 'Universal jailbreaks' To mitigate the risk of their systems being used for nefarious purposes, companies deploy numerous safeguards. But researchers were able to find \"universal jailbreaks\" - or workarounds - for all the models studied which would allow them to dodge these protections. However, for some models, the time it took for experts to persuade systems to circumvent safeguards had increased forty-fold in just six months. The report also found an increase in the use of tools which allowed AI agents to perform \"high-stakes tasks\" in critical sectors such as finance. But researchers did not consider AI's potential to cause unemployment in the short-term by displacing human workers. The institute also did not examine the environmental impact of the computing resources required by advanced models, arguing that its task was to focus on \"societal impacts\" that are closely linked to AI's abilities rather than more \"diffuse\" economic or environmental effects. Some argue both are imminent and serious societal threats posed by the tech. And hours before the AISI report was published, a peer-reviewed study suggested the environmental impact could be greater than previously thought , and argued for more detailed data to be released by big tech.",

Notifications seen by some users based in the UK and US say they can only share a certain number of links in Facebook posts without a subscription - which starts at £9.99 per month. Meta has described it as \"a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value\" for subscribers. Social media expert Matt Navarra said it signifies the company's bid to monetise more areas of its platforms. \"This isn't really about verification as much as about bundling survival features behind a subscription,\" he told the BBC. Meta Verified offers Facebook and Instagram users a blue tick, \"enhanced\" account support and protection from impersonation. Mr Navarra said having already put a price on such features, the company now appeared to be doing the same for content distribution and \"the basic ability to send people\" to other parts of the internet. He was among those recently notified of Facebook's test - having received a notification saying from 16 December he would only be able to share two links a month in Facebook posts. \"If you're a creator or a business, I think the message is essentially if Facebook is a part of your growth or traffic strategy, that access now has a price tag attached to it,\" Mr Navarra told the BBC. \"And that's new in its explicitness, even if it's been the direction of travel for a while.\" 'Brutal reality' Alongside other social platforms such as LinkedIn, Meta has encouraged users to verify themselves as a way to unlock more features or engagement on its platforms. Elon Musk overhauled Twitter's verification scheme after he bought the platform in 2022 - with X's blue verified ticks reserved for those who pay, and giving holders a boosted presence in replies to posts and on its For You feed. This has proved controversial, with the EU fining it €120m (£105m) in December . Nonetheless, Mark Zuckerberg's company Meta rolled out a similar scheme shortly thereafter . It said it would also echo Musk's changes at X with a \"community notes\" tool for users to label misleading posts, after making cuts to moderation and fact checkers . Facebook told tech news publication TechCrunch its link-limiting test extended to a select group of users of its \"professional mode\" or Pages. The features are used by many creators and businesses to promote content on the platform and gain insights into how it has performed with users. \"For creators it reinforces a pretty brutal reality that Facebook is no longer a reliable traffic engine and Meta is increasingly nudging it away from people trying to use it as one,\" Mr Navarra said. He said it also served as a reminder that \"Meta will always optimise for Meta, first\". \"Tests like this underline why building a business that's overly dependent on any one platform's goodwill is incredibly risky,\" he said.",

Nearly half of parents with children aged 18 or younger plan to allow phones at the Christmas dinner table this year, according to a recent survey. \"I can't tell you how many children tell me about sitting at dinner and the parents are on the phone,\" Dame Rachel said. \"So this Christmas, let's turn them off.\" Research by More in Common for Yondr found nearly four in 10 adults say smartphones have disrupted their Christmas in some way. The children's commissioner said while she had been guilty of using her phone at meal times in the past, setting clear guidelines for everyone, not just children, was key. \"We have to lead as adults,\" Dame Rachel said. \"We can't talk about banning for the kids if we're not doing it ourselves.\" Her comments came as she launched a new guide offering tips for children's safety online and how to set boundaries for screen time. Pete Etchells, psychology professor at Bath Spa University, told BBC News Christmas is a good time to lean into conversations with children about developing healthy relationships with tech. \"It's not about feeling guilty or ashamed of our tech use, but noticing it more,\" he said. \"And striking up conversations about what we're happy with, and what we would like to be doing differently.\" The new guide by the commissioner, available online , has been released to support parents who \"may feel overwhelmed\" by \"mixed messages\" around online safety, and is informed by child focus groups. In it, parents can find \"practical tips\" and \"conversation starters\" on how to talk around topics such as managing screen time, dealing with negative online experiences, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI). Teenagers aged 13 to 18 told Dame Rachel they accepted bad things can happen online, feeling it was an inevitable part of the online world. They also shared how they had been contacted by strangers, seen pornography, and were aware of intimate images of their peers being shared. Dame Rachel said it was essential for parents to \"talk early and talk often\" with their children about their presence online. Arabella Skinner from Health Professionals for Safer Screens told BBC News simple rules can make a difference. She suggested creating a family plan around device use, or designing a box to store mobiles during meals. \"Children feel most secure and content when they have our full attention, eye contact, and presence,\" she said. \"It is so important that we, as adults, spend time with our children and not always looking at screens.\" A report published by the regulator Ofcom earlier this month highlighted concerns children had over the negative impacts of endless screentime and \"brain rot\".

      "summary_tr_long": "Fifa will finally release its much-anticipated return to video games in 2026, several years after its acrimonious split with developer EA. But it is Netflix, rather than a major game studio, which has secured the rights to the upcoming football game. Once one of the most profitable brands in gaming history, issues including a costly licence prompted Fifa's previous publisher Electronic Arts to stop using the name in 2023 - instead naming its best-selling game EA Sports FC. Netflix said the new Fifa would be developed and published by Delphi Interactive - which has yet to release a video game - and released ahead of the 2026 World Cup. It said subscribers will be able to play online via the Netflix app on iOS and Android devices - or on select TVs by using their phone as the controller. EA Sports released the first Fifa game in 1993, and ran the franchise for 30 years until moving away from the branding to create its own. The series was estimated to have around 150 million players. But the renamed game still connected with fans - with EA FC 24 being the best-selling game in the UK in 2023 . Fifa president Gianni Infantino said the football governing body was \"very excited\" to team up with Netflix Games ahead of the World Cup in 2026. \"Our reimagined game truly marks the beginning of a new era of digital football,\" he said. \"It will be available for free to Netflix members and is a great historic step for Fifa.\" California-based Delphi Interactive, the studio behind the game, is also working in partnership with IO Interactive on a new James Bond title, 007: First Light. The firm's boss Casper Daugaard said as \"lifelong Fifa fans\" it wanted to make the game \"the most fun, approachable, and global football game ever created\". Reaction to the announcement has so far been mixed, with some fans questioning whether the mobile-first focus from Netflix was the way forward for the franchise. \"FIFA should never have left EA,\" said one person on social media site X .",

      "summary_tr_long": "Downing Street insists negotiations over US-UK tech deal still live Liv McMahon Technology reporter Reuters Downing Street says the UK remains in \"active conversations with US counterparts at all levels of government\" about a wide-ranging tech deal. The BBC understands talks over the Technology Prosperity Deal have stalled because of US concerns about what it considers to be wider UK trade barriers. Billed as \"historic\" when it was unveiled during US President Donald Trump's state visit in September, the partnership saw both countries pledge to co-operate further in areas such as AI and quantum computing. \"We're confident of securing a deal that will shape the future of millions on both sides of the Atlantic,\" the Prime Minister's official spokesman said. He said he would not comment directly on what were \"live\" discussions but added \"negotiations of this kind are never straightforward\". The New York Times - which first reported the story - said there were \"broader disagreements\" between the two sides, including over digital regulations and food safety rules. The UK government did not comment on these specific claims. The White House has not responded to the BBC's request for a comment. However, Trump's science adviser Michael Kratsios on Tuesday evening said the administration hoped to restart talks over the deal. \"In line with Section III of the US-UK Technology Prosperity Deal, we hope to resume work with the United Kingdom once the UK has made substantial progress in implementing its commitments under the Economic Prosperity Deal,\" Kratsios wrote on X. \"We look forward to continuing our productive collaboration across AI, quantum, nuclear, and other critical technology areas under the Deal.\" When the deal was announced the government was keen to highlight the benefits it said it would bring. \"This Tech Prosperity Deal marks a generational step change in our relationship with the US,\" Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said in a statement. Technology secretary Liz Kendall said the partnership would \"transform lives across Britain\" and was a \"vote of confidence in Britain's booming AI sector.\" At the same time the deal was revealed, a series of US tech firms announced a flurry of investment in the UK. A total of £31bn in planned spending was set out by tech giants including Microsoft, Nvidia and Google. It is believed those investment plans are unaffected. Google, Microsoft and Nvidia have also been approached for comment, but the firms have not yet responded to the BBC. Nvidia boss Jensen Huang said in September his company's UK investment reflected his belief it could become an \"AI superpower\" - an ambition championed by Sir Keir's government. It said investment announced by tech firms alongside the Tech Prosperity Deal would be used to scale-up AI infrastructure such as data centres, across the UK. 'Piecemeal approach' The tech pact was documented in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which said both countries would seek to collaborate across AI, quantum computing and nuclear power. It said this could include working together to build \"powerful quantum machines,\" support innovation in AI hardware and explore potential new ways to use advanced nuclear energy. But the MOU also states any proposals are not binding and that it only \"becomes operative alongside substantive progress being made to formalise and implement\" the wider US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal, signed in May. The Trump administration has sought to rewrite the global rules on trade, imposing tariffs on many countries - including traditional allies like the UK - and seeking new deals which it argues are fairer to the US. For the UK that has meant haggling over various sectors of the economy, a process which has yielded agreements on cars and more recently, pharmaceuticals . However, a proposed deal to eliminate tariffs on UK steel exports to the US has been put on hold indefinitely, the BBC understands. Allie Renison, director of communications firm SEC Newgate UK and a former government trade adviser, said the current impasse over tech reflected the US and UK's \"slightly piecemeal approach\" to inking trade deals. \"Instead of having everything done at once, different areas are being linked to different parts,\" she told the BBC - noting how concerns about separate trade areas may now be affecting tech agreements. While questions hung over what the potential roadblocks could mean for US tech firms' pledged investments in the UK, Ms Renison added, it was unlikely to be little more than \"a bit of posturing in the wider negotiations\".

Led by technology secretary Liz Kendall, it will see female leaders from tech companies and organisations advise the government on how to boost diversity and economic growth in the industry. BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, recently suggested women accounted for only 22% of those working in IT specialist roles in the UK. Ms Kendall said the Women in Tech group would \"break down the barriers that still hold too many people back\". \"When women are inspired to take on a role in tech and have a seat at the table, the sector can make more representative decisions, build products that serve everyone,\" she said. BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, warned in December the amount of women working in the UK tech sector still lagged far behind men. It said the government should look to help close the gender gap in order to meet its ambitious AI goals . \"We cannot create high-trust, high-integrity AI systems if the profession behind them is missing out on the talents and perspective of half the population,\" said chief executive Sharron Gunn. Ms Kendall will lead the taskforce alongside Anne-Marie Imafidon, founder of Stemettes, who has been appointed as the Women in Tech Envoy. Dr Imafidon, who passed A-level computing aged 11 and received a Master's Degree in Maths and Computer Science from the University of Oxford aged 20, has sought to encourage more young women into careers in Stem - science, technology, engineering and maths. She told the BBC her role would build on more than a decade of work to establish greater equality for - and representation of - women. But now, amid what she called \"a fourth industrial revolution\", was a key moment to \"be part of shifting who is making those decisions for what comes next\". \"This isn't just about having women being the driving force and building the technology, but this is about building technology that benefits everybody,\" she said. 'Equality long overdue' The government said the taskforce will advise on ways to make the tech sector more representative and \"ensure the UK accesses the full talent pool, market opportunities, and innovation capacity needed for economic growth\". BT Group boss Allison Kirkby, Revolut chief executive Francesca Carlesi and Dr Hayaatun Sillem, chief executive of the Royal Academy of Engineering, are among its 15 founding members. It also includes TUC assistant general secretary Kate Bell, director of public policy at Uber Emma O'Dwyer, and Sue Daley, director of technology and innovation at industry group techUK. \"Entry routes, career progression to leadership, and access to capital are just some of the barriers women in tech still face today,\" Ms Daley said. \"Achieving gender equality is long overdue, and I am honoured to join the Women in Tech taskforce alongside Liz Kendall and several inspiring women from across the industry, working together to chart a path forward for true gender equality.\"",

Thousands of Three customers reported they were unable to make calls in June , while BT and EE customers were hit by a similar outage in July . The regulator said it would examine whether the mobile networks did not do enough to prevent the problems. Three said in a statement it was engaging with Ofcom. A BT Group spokesperson apologised to customers who had been affected. \"We will co-operate fully with Ofcom throughout the investigation and apologise again for any issues caused by this incident,\" they said. Meanwhile, Three said it had \"experienced disruption to voice services following an exceptional spike in network traffic triggered by a third-party software configuration change\". \"Since the outage, we have engaged openly with Ofcom and will continue to cooperate fully with their investigation,\" it said. According to Ofcom, firms must take proper action to identify risks and prepare for \"anything that compromises the availability, performance or functionality of their network or service\". It said providers must also prevent \"adverse effects arising from any such compromises\" - saying where this happens, they must take steps to mitigate them. \"The importance of connectivity cannot be underestimated,\" said telecoms analyst Paolo Pescatore. \"We all demand a robust and reliable connection at home and out and about.\" He said outages can occur despite \"significant efforts\" to prevent them - but said there must be \"a straightforward process to identify the issue and to learn lessons so it does not happen again\". Previous problems The incidents at the heart of Ofcom's investigation saw thousands of customers across BT and Three networks report problems with their mobile service. At the time, Three told customers complaining of issues making and receiving calls on 25 June it was experiencing \"an issue affecting voice services\". This was not isolated to its own network - it also caused problems for customers on networks that piggyback off of Three, such as ID Mobile. A month later, EE and BT customers complained of similar issues. A government spokesperson said at the time \"communications providers have statutory obligations to ensure their networks and services are appropriately resilient\". Operators have previously faced scrutiny over outages or issues affecting peoples' ability to make calls or contact emergency services. BT was fined £17.5m in July 2024 for a \"catastrophic failure\" of its emergency call handling service which led to thousands of 999 calls not being connected. Three was ordered to pay £1.9m in 2017 after Ofcom found it could have prevented an issue that caused a loss of service for customers a year prior.

Founded in 1990 by three members of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Artificial Intelligence Lab, iRobot initially focused on defence and space technology before launching the Roomba in 2002.",
      "summary_tr_long": "The US firm behind the Roomba smart vacuum cleaner, iRobot, has filed for bankruptcy protection after facing competition from Chinese rivals and being hit by tariffs. Under the so-called pre-packaged Chapter 11 process , the main manufacturer of its devices, Shenzhen-based Picea Robotics, will take ownership of the firm. The tough commercial landscape had forced iRobot to cut its prices and make major investments in new technology, according to documents filed on Sunday. US import duties of 46% on goods from Vietnam, where most of iRobot's devices for the American market are made, increased its costs by $23m (£17.2m) this year, the firm said. The loss-making company was valued at $3.56bn in 2021 after the pandemic helped to drive strong demand for its products. On Friday, iRobot's shares fell by more than 13% on the technology-heavy Nasdaq trading platform in New York. iRobot said the bankruptcy filing was not expected to disrupt its app, supply chains or product support. Founded in 1990 by three members of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Artificial Intelligence Lab, iRobot initially focused on defence and space technology before launching the Roomba in 2002. The Roomba holds about 42% of the US market share and 65% of the Japanese market share for robotic vacuum cleaners, according to the company. Last year, a planned $1.7bn takeover deal by online retail giant Amazon was derailed by the European Union 's competition watchdog. Trade tariffs imposed by US Donald Trump on goods entering America from overseas has added to costs to many businesses, including iRobot, which rely on imports for product manufacturing. Trump has argued that the import taxes will boost American jobs and industry. Picea is a manufacturer of robotic vacuum cleaners, with research and development and production facilities in China and Vietnam. It has more than 7,000 employees worldwide and has sold more than 20 million robotic vacuum cleaners.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Grand Theft Auto game creator sacked us for trying to unionise Hope Webb BBC Scotland reporter BBC The workers have been protesting outside the firm's headquarters in Edinburgh and London Former staff at the firm behind Grand Theft Auto have told the BBC that a \"devastating\" mass sacking took place allegedly because they tried to unionise. Some 31 employees were dismissed in October for what Rockstar North called \"gross misconduct\". The majority were based at the gaming giant's Edinburgh headquarters, with former workers claiming they were penalised for discussing working conditions in a private online forum. Rockstar North said it was incorrect to suggest the dismissals were linked to union membership or activities. It said it took action after staff discussed confidential information, including specific game features from upcoming titles, in a public forum. The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) called it a \"ruthless act of union-busting\". Rockstar North is one of the UK's largest game developers. Its upcoming GTA 6 game is expected to be one of the best-selling games of all time when it is released in November 2026. Information about game development is tightly controlled across the gaming industry, with employees often signing legally binding agreements not to share confidential information. A group of workers have been routinely protesting outside Rockstar North's Edinburgh and London offices. BBC Scotland News has now spoken to three of the dismissed Edinburgh workers accused of disclosing company information. Jordan Garland said staff wanted to unionise to improve the workplace Jordan Garland, a former senior production co-ordinator, said many staff members wanted to unionise because \"we were so passionate about the industry and that workplace in particular\". \"We just saw it as something we could do to make it better for everyone,\" he added. \"So it's a little bit devastating because it's an industry that I love, and I think we all love. We couldn't really see ourselves anywhere else.\" 'Sleepless nights' He said members of staff were discussing working conditions at the firm in a private digital forum. Jordan added: \"We were talking about working conditions, policy - not talking about projects or anything like that, just talking about conditions. \"That to me that feels like an essential, necessary part of organising. How can you organise a workplace if you can't talk about the conditions there?\" Jordan has worked at the company for 11 years and believes he was the first employee to be dismissed on the morning of 30 October. \"The first week was definitely difficult,\" he said. \"It was a lot of sleepless nights, a lot of tossing and turning about this. \"But in a kind of macabre way, it's good they fired so many people because there is this really strong community element now.\" Jamie Trimmer worked at Rockstar North for about 18 years before he was sacked Designer Jamie Trimmer worked in the gaming industry for most of his adult life before being sacked from Rockstar North. \"I've worked there, like, 18 years now,\" he said. \"I think I'm the longest serving person that was fired. \"It's all I know really, and then it's just sort of ripped away. I'm left not knowing what to do next really. \"I never would have expected they would hit the nuclear option of firing so many of us in one go. It does highlight the need for unions.\" 'Deeply concerning' The group, along with fellow dismissed colleagues, are now hoping to take Rockstar North to an employment tribunal. However, they may have to wait up to a year for their case to be heard. In the meantime, they are waiting to learn if they qualify for an intermediate relief hearing, which could see them reinstated in their roles or kept on Rockstar North's payroll. The issue was also raised at Prime Minister's Questions in Westminster last week by MP Chris Murray. Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"deeply concerning\" and promised to look into the issue. He added: \"Every worker has the right to join a trade union, and we're determined to strengthen workers' rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union.\" Sarah Blackburn said she appreciated the support after she lost her job at Rockstar North Sacked production co-ordinator Sarah Blackburn said the public and political support has helped her deal with the situation. \"It's massively heartening to hear actually and in a way, I'd say validating,\" she said. \"We've had a lot of support coming from places that I genuinely didn't expect. \"We've had people who were in unions who previously fought fights in different industries basically just expressing solidarity and support. It's a flex of power and it's been painful to be on this side of it, but I think the support has been great.\" In a statement, Rockstar North told BBC Scotland News: \"Rockstar Games took action against a small group of individuals, across the UK and internationally, who distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations. \"Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading.\"",

      "summary_tr_long": "A billionaire investor keen on buying TikTok's US operations has told the BBC he has been left in limbo as the latest deadline for the app's sale looms. The US has repeatedly delayed the date by which the platform's Chinese owner, ByteDance, must sell or be blocked for American users. US President Donald Trump initially gave himself until December 16 to comply with the law before moving the deadline to 23 January 2026 with a new executive order. \"We're just standing by and waiting to see what happens,\" investor Frank McCourt told BBC News. \"But if the moment arrives, we're prepared to move forward... we've raised the capital to buy it - we'll see.\" The popular short-form video app was due to be banned or sold in the US in January in accordance with a law passed by Congress in 2024. Lawmakers said at the time ByteDance's links to the Chinese government threatened national security, and expressed fears Beijing could force the company to hand over data on US users. It's a concern TikTok and its owners have always said is unfounded. The law was signed by President Joe Biden while he was still in office and was upheld by the Supreme Court in early 2025. Trump and members of his administration have previously claimed a TikTok deal was done , and had the blessing of Chinese President Xi Jinping. The president has also said \"sophisticated\" US investors would be involved in acquiring the app , including two of his allies: Oracle chairman Larry Ellison and Dell Technologies' Michael Dell. Members of the Trump administration had indicated the deal would be formalised in a meeting between Trump and Xi in October - however it concluded without an agreement being reached. Neither TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance nor Beijing have since announced approval of a sale, despite Trump's claims. When Trump signed his most recent executive order extending the deadline to January, he said in an online post it would lead to a deal being completed. Without naming Trump's hand-selected investors, Mr McCourt told the BBC he was concerned \"about a concentration of power and influence because platforms like TikTok are very influencing\". He is part of a group of investors including Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and Canadian investor Kevin O'Leary. \"My hope would be that whatever happens, that it is shut down or sold, and lands in the hands of people that comply with the law,\" he said. He said he wants to operate TikTok without any of its Chinese technology, including its powerful recommendation algorithm, and that his Project Liberty has developed other technology that could be used instead.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Online gaming escaped Australia's social media ban - but critics say it's just as addictive Katy Watson Australia correspondent , Perth Getty Images Critics say gaming platforms should be included in Australia's ban on social media for under-16s Wednesday afternoons have become a ritual for 15-year-old Sadmir Perviz. Sadmir and his board game companions are just some of the 300 patients at the gaming disorder clinic, Australia's only publicly-run institution of its type, helping patients wean themselves off excessive online gaming habits. It's a bit of a departure for the 15-year-old who until a couple of months ago preferred to play games with friends online for 10 hours a day. You can interact with people, so you actually know who's there rather than just being on a call with random people.\" Dr Daniela Vecchio, the psychiatrist who set up the clinic, says that while gaming isn't bad in itself, it can become a problem - an addiction even. So, she wonders why gaming platforms have not been included in Australia's \"world-first\" social media ban for under-16s. The ban, which came into force on Wednesday, is supposed to prevent teens from having accounts on 10 social media platforms including Instagram, Snapchat and X. \"The individual who plays games for excessive amounts of time also spends excessive amounts of time on social media platforms where they can see other gamers or can live stream gaming, so it's a way to connect.\" Dr Daniela Vecchio runs Australia's only publicly funded clinic for gaming disorder clinic Sadmir, for example, spent much of his time on the gaming platform Steam, as well as YouTube. Dr Vecchio singles out the platforms Discord and Roblox as particular worries - a concern echoed by many experts and parents the BBC has spoken to in covering the ban and its impact. Both Roblox and Discord have been dogged by claims that some children are being exposed to explicit or harmful content through them and are facing lawsuits relating to child safety in the US. The 'wild west of internet usage' Former gaming clinic patient Kevin Koo, 35, wonders whether a social media ban could have influenced the access he got at a younger age. So I think that for me, the damage has already been done.\" A former quantum finance intern interested in AI, Mr Koo lost his job just before the pandemic. Dr Vecchio agrees with the comparison - if she had her way, she'd be tempted not just to expand the social media ban to gaming but to raise the age to 18. Gaming disorder is also now recognised by the World Health Organisation as an official diagnosis and, according to a 2022 Macquarie University study, around 2.8% of Australian children are affected by it. Kevin Koo, 35, wonders whether he might have benefited from a social media ban The Australian government says its ban is about protecting kids from harmful content, cyberbullying, online grooming and \"predatory algorithms\" among other things – some or all of which could arguably be said to exist with gaming platforms. Instead, platforms have been selected according to three criteria: whether the platform's sole or \"significant purpose\" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users; whether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and whether it allows users to post. in 60 seconds Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University and chief investigator at the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Digital Child, says the ban on social media is too blunt a tool – instead a more nuanced approach is needed, including towards gaming platforms. \"There is such a wide spectrum of gaming from incredibly positive, nurturing, fun, creative, expressive spaces - something like Minecraft comes to mind where it's had so many positive uses.\" However, platforms like Roblox are at the other end of the spectrum, he says. And we know that some of the games that have been made that clearly feel like they're meant for adults have been accessed by very young people.\" On Professor Leaver's desk at the university are three plushies with inbuilt ChatGPT inside them. \"I do think we're at a moment, and it's not just Australia, you look across the EU, there is huge appetite for all sorts of regulation.\" A treatment plan, not a cure In Mr Koo's case, for example, his vice wasn't just gaming. It was AI chatbots, another feature of online life that has come under scrutiny for everything from making things up to allegedly encouraging children to kill themselves . There is evidence they are designed to manipulate users into prolonging interactions and their use has even given rise to a new phenomenon called AI psychosis , in which people increasingly rely on AI chatbots and then become convinced that something imaginary has become real. Mr Koo also started googling his mental health issues and relying on AI to help confirm his diagnoses. \"I do think being able to read human emotions and having that face-to-face conversation with someone is completely different.\" The government has said it will continually review the list of banned platforms and at the end of November added Twitch, a streaming platform where people typically play video games while chatting to viewers. Communications Minister Anika Wells also told the BBC last week that the eSafety Commissioner \"definitely has her eye on Roblox\". \"Children need to be protected, they need to be safeguarded.\" Update 15 December: This article has been amended to remove a contributor for editorial reasons.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Amazon has pulled a video recap made with artificial intelligence (AI) from its hit TV show Fallout after users said it got several facts wrong about the series. The firm said in November it was testing the \"first-of-its-kind\" tool in the US to help viewers catch up on some of its shows on streaming service Prime Video - including Fallout, its adaptation of the popular video game franchise. But it has since disappeared from the site after users highlighted mistakes in its video summarising the events of Fallout season one - including claiming one scene was set more than 100 years earlier than it was. The BBC has approached Amazon for comment. The move to apparently press pause on its AI-powered recaps was first reported by tech publication The Verge . Amazon said in November the recaps would be available to users as an experimental feature, and only \"for select English-language Prime Original series in the US\". \"Video Recaps use AI to summarise a show's most pertinent plot points with a theatrical-quality video that includes narration, dialogue, and music,\" it said . But fans eagerly awaiting the release of the next series of Fallout on 17 December highlighted errors introduced in its video recap for its first series. Users on Reddit said a clip showing The Ghoul - one of the show's central characters, played by actor Walton Goggins - was wrongly described in the AI narration as a \"1950s flashback\". Despite the clip's retro aesthetic, it actually depicts a scene in 2077 - something fans of the series would know instantly. Fans also said the recap incorrectly summarised a scene between The Ghoul and protagonist Lucy MacLean, played by Ella Purnell, altering their dynamic in a way that would confuse new viewers. It joins a long list of errors have being introduced when using generative AI tools to produce content summaries. In early 2025, Apple suspended an AI feature summarising notifications after it drew complaints for repeated mistakes in its summaries of news headlines. The BBC was among the groups to complain about the feature , after an alert generated by Apple's AI falsely told some readers Luigi Mangione, who has been charged in the US with killing UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson, had shot himself. Google's AI Overviews, which aim to provide concise summaries of search results, have also come under criticism and mockery for errors .",

      "summary_tr_long": "Creative industries 'incredibly worried' about OpenAI-Disney deal Shiona McCallum Senior technology reporter Alamy A union representing workers in the creative industries says there is \"real concern\" among its members about a $1bn (£740m) deal which will see Disney characters brought to ChatGPT and video-generation tool Sora. It is the first major studio to license parts of its catalogue to OpenAI, which makes the tools. Fans will be able to generate and share pictures and videos of more than 200 characters from Disney's franchises, including Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars. \"Everyone in the entertainment industry, especially all the creative talent, are incredibly worried about what the implications are,\" said Sag-Aftra executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland. He said the two companies had contacted the union - which represents 170,000 media professionals worldwide - to say the agreement specifically rules out the use of the image, likeness or voice of human performers. But he said it was still a worrying development. \"There's real concern because nobody wants to see human creativity given away to AI models,\" he told BBC News. 'An important moment for our industry' The move comes as OpenAI faces mounting questions about how its rapidly advancing tech is used - and as anxiety in Hollywood increases over the impact of AI on the creative industries. According to a blog post announcing the news, the list of eligible characters include those from Disney films Zootopia, Moana and Encanto - as well as characters like Star Wars' Luke Skywalker and Marvel's Deadpool. It, of course, also includes Mickey and Minnie Mouse. But quite how the characters will sound remains unclear, as Disney said the agreement \"does not include any talent likenesses or voices\". \"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry,\" Disney boss Bob Iger said. \"Through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling.\" People are expected to be able to begin making the videos and images in Sora and ChatGPT in early 2026. The deal comes amid reports Disney lawyers sent Google a cease-and-desist letter on Wednesday accusing the tech firm of infringing its copyrights \"on a massive scale\". The BBC has asked Google for a response. Joel Smith, intellectual property partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons, said Disney's OpenAI deal showed \"rights owners and major AI developers are moving fast to strike collaborative licensing deals to access content for training and future use\". Equity, the entertainment trade union, says actors' rights need to be protected. The group is currently balloting thousands of performers asking if they are willing to refuse being digitally scanned on set to push for stronger AI safeguards. Cathy Sweet, Equity's head of TV and Film, said the deal between Disney and OpenAI reinforced \"exactly why our members are fighting for AI protections\". \"The recorded material that will be sold on as part of this eye-watering big money deal are the result of creatives' professional work, and their rights must be protected,\" she said. Content concerns Sora's hyper-realistic videos have proven to be popular in the US, but there have been significant criticisms from those claiming it has also led to some people creating offensive deepfakes of dead public figures. In October, OpenAI paused the video tool's ability to generate images of Dr Martin Luther King Jr after the app produced \"disrespectful\" depictions of the civil rights leader. The firm acknowledged the need for stronger safeguards after clips emerged showing him saying offensive things, prompting a public outcry. Other similar videos of President John F. Kennedy, Queen Elizabeth II and physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking also circulated widely. In some cases, family members called on OpenAI to stop allowing videos to be made. Zelda Williams, daughter of the late comedian Robin Williams, urged people to stop sending her AI-generated videos of her father. In November, Warner Music Group announced plans to launch an AI music venture with technology start-up Suno , a year after it sued the firm in a landmark case.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Clair Obscur sweeps The Game Awards with nine wins Tom Richardson BBC Newsbeat Clair Obscur sweeps The Game Awards with nine wins Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been named game of the year in a record-breaking haul at this year's Game Awards. The French-developed role-playing game (RPG) cleaned up in nine of the 10 categories it was up for, with further wins in best narrative, best music and best performance. It fended off competition from Death Stranding 2, Nintendo platformer Donkey Kong Bananza, indie games Hollow Knight: Silksong and Hades 2, and medieval adventure Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 to claim the top prize. During the ceremony in Los Angeles, players also got their first glimpses of two new Tomb Raider games, sequel Control Resonant and a new Star Wars role-playing game. Clair Obscur is set in a world where a supernatural being known as The Paintress prevents the population from growing past a certain age. The game, which tells the story of a group of adventurers on a quest to destroy The Paintress, was praised for its emotional narrative and use of old-school, turn-based battles. Players were also won over by the story of developer Sandfall Interactive, formed by a group of employees who left gaming giant Ubisoft to make their dream project . Accepting the game of the year award, director Guillaume Broche - wearing a red beret and striped t-shirt in a nod to the game's strong French identity - said the year had been a \"weird timeline\" for the studio as he thanked his team. He also extended thanks to the \"unsung heroes\" of the industry - \"the people who make tutorials on YouTube on how to make a game, because we had no idea how to make one before\". AFP via Getty Images Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's director Guillaume Broche accepted the game of the year prize Clair Obscur was the hot favourite going into the awards, and the most-nominated game in the ceremony's history with a total of 12 nods. It was the debut project for the musician, who was discovered after he posted a collection of homemade video game music to his SoundCloud account. Three of its nominations were in a single category - best performance - and actress Jennifer English claimed the prize over co-stars Charlie Cox and Ben Starr for her role as Maelle. The actress, who has often spoken about having ADHD, dedicated the award \"to every neurodivergent person watching\". Getty Images Jennifer English has appeared in three game of the year-winning titles, including Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3 Clair Obscur only missed out on two awards it was up for. Battlefield 6 won best audio design, while open-world action RPG Wuthering Waves was a surprising winner in the fan-voted Player's Voice category. Sequel Hollow Knight: Silksong was named best action-adventure, while anime-inspired horse racing game Umamusume: Pretty Derby was named best mobile game. The non-profit group encourages girls and young women to pursue careers in video games, and runs summer camps to teach programming and design skills. Stranger Things star David Harbour took to the stage to announce a new Total War: Warhammer 40K strategy game, and US singer Lenny Kravitz officially revealed his villainous role in the upcoming James Bond game 007: First Light. Team Cherry Hollow Knight: Silksong, one of the year's most anticipated games, was named best action-adventure Despite being referred to as the \"Oscars of gaming\", the Game Awards, hosted by its founder Geoff Keighley, is a mixture of traditional ceremony and trailer showcase. Some of the games industry's biggest developers will give the first look at upcoming major titles during the show, and it's thought that this is one of the main reasons many fans tune in. One of the night's biggest announcements was RPG Divinity from Larian Studios, the maker of 2023 game of the year Baldur's Gate 3. A remake of the original Tomb Raider game had also been leaked, but the announcement of a second, brand new entry starring Lara Croft came as a surprise. Star Wars fans got a glimpse at two new games - Fate of the Old Republic, a long-awaited successor to 2004's beloved Knights of the Old Republic, and Galactic Racer, developed by UK-based studio Fuse Games. The cast of the new Street Fighter movie adaptation, with the exception of rapper 50 Cent, introduced its first trailer. And fans also saw new footage from the upcoming Resident Evil 9, confirming the appearance of fan-favourite character Leon Kennedy, and PS5 shooter Saros. Donkey Kong Bananza was named best Family Game The Game Awards has been criticised in the past for prioritising advertising over awards, with winning speeches being cut short and on-stage presentations being absent in some categories. There was praise of 2024's show for going some way to address criticisms, but developers have continued to call on organiser Geoff Keighley to better acknowledge problems in the industry, such as the high number of job losses in recent years. This year, there have been complaints about the awards abandoning its Future Class scheme - an initiative founded in 2020 to highlight \"rising stars\" in video games. It was last run in 2023, when current and former members of the group signed an open letter urging the awards to address the Israel-Gaza war. In the run-up to this year's nominations, after it was confirmed Future Class would not return, alumni accused the scheme of tokenism and not doing enough to help them build contacts. BBC Newsbeat has approached organisers for comment. Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here .",

      "summary_tr_long": "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at blocking states from enforcing their own artificial intelligence (AI) regulations. \"We want to have one central source of approval,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. It will give the Trump administration tools to push back on the most \"onerous\" state rules, said White House AI adviser David Sacks. The government will not oppose AI regulations around children's safety, he added. The move marks a win for technology giants who have called for US-wide AI legislation as it could have a major impact on America's goal of leading the fast-developing industry. AI company bosses have argued that state-level regulations could slow innovation and hinder the US in its race against China to dominate the industry, as firms pour billions of dollars into the technology. But the move to pre-empt state laws has drawn opposition. While the US currently has no national laws regulating AI, more than 1,000 separate AI bills have been introduced in states across the US, according to the White House. This year alone, 38 states including California, home to many of the world's biggest technology companies, have adopted some 100 AI regulations, the National Conference of State Legislatures says. One in California requires platforms to regularly remind users they are interacting with a chatbot, in a bid to protect children and teens from potential harms. The state also passed a bill requiring the largest AI developers to lay out plans to limit potential catastrophic risks stemming from their AI models. In North Dakota, a new law would prevent people from using AI-powered robots to stalk or harass others, while Arkansas bars AI content from infringing on intellectual property rights or existing copyright. Oregon brought in a law prohibiting a \"non-human entity\" including one powered by AI from using licenced medical titles, such as registered nurse. Critics of Trump's executive order have argued that state rules are necessary in the absence of meaningful guardrails at the federal level. \"Stripping states from enacting their own AI safeguards undermines states' basic rights to establish sufficient guardrails to protect their residents,\" said Julie Scelfo, from advocacy group Mothers Against Media Addiction in a statement. California's Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and vocal critic of the president, accused Trump of bowing to the interests of tech allies with the executive order. \"Today, President Trump continued his ongoing grift in the White House, attempting to enrich himself and his associates, with a new executive order seeking to preempt state laws protecting Americans from unregulated AI technology,\" he said. AI firms OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the order. But the move drew praise from tech lobby group NetChoice. \"We look forward to working with the White House and Congress to set nationwide standards and a clear rulebook for innovators,\" said its director of policy Patrick Hedger. Michael Goodyear, an associate professor at New York Law School, said the AI industry was rightly alarmed about having to comply with a patchwork of rules, which might conflict. \"It would be better to have one federal law than a bunch of conflicting state laws,\" he said. But, he added: \"That assumes that we will have a good federal law in place.\"",

      "summary_tr_long": "Google asks UK experts to find uses for its powerful quantum tech Chris Vallance Senior technology reporter Google Google's quantum chip which the firm dubbed Willow Google has announced plans to team up with the UK to invite researchers to come up with uses for the tech giant's state-of-the-art quantum chip Willow. It is one of several firms competing to develop a powerful quantum computer - which is seen as an exciting new frontier in the future of computing. Researchers hope they will be able to crack problems in fields such as chemistry and medicine which are impossible for current computers to solve. Professor Paul Stevenson of the University of Surrey - who had no involvement with the agreement - told the BBC it was \"great news for UK researchers\". The collaboration between Google and the UK's national lab for quantum computing means more researchers will get access to the technology. \"The new ability to access Google's Willow processor, through open competition, puts UK researchers in an enviable position,\" said Prof Stevenson. \"It is good news for Google, too, who will benefit from the skills of UK academics.\" Quantum devices work in a fundamentally different way to the computers powering our smartphones and laptops, solving problems using technologies based on the science of particle physics But the full potential of the technology has yet to be realised and the machines that currently exist have few practical applications and most are experimental. It is hoped giving UK researchers access to Willow would help \"uncover new real world applications\". Scientists will be able to submit proposals describing how they intend to use the chip, and they will work with experts from Google and the UK quantum lab to design and conduct experiments. Quantum competition When it was unveiled in 2024, Google's Willow chip was seen as a significant step forward in the field. Rival firms including Amazon and IBM are also developing their own tech. The UK has a significant quantum industry. Quantinuum, which has headquarters in Cambridge and Colorado, US, reached a $10bn (£7.45bn) valuation in September. Announcements of new developments from firms throughout 2025 have led some experts to believe powerful machines capable of having real-world impact will be developed within a decade. Dr Michael Cuthbert, Director at the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC) said the partnership would \"accelerate discovery\". He said the cutting edge science it would support could ultimately lead to quantum computing being used in areas such as \"life science, materials, chemistry, and fundamental physics\". The NQCC already hosts seven quantum computers from British-based firms such as Quantum Motion, ORCA and Oxford Ionics. The government says it is committing £670m to support the tech, which is a priority area in the UK's Industrial Strategy. Officials believe quantum could contribute £11 billion to the UK economy by 2045.",

      "summary_tr_long": "A former crypto entrepreneur who was behind two digital currencies that collapsed and lost an estimated $40bn (£29.9bn) has been sentenced by a New York judge to 15 years in prison for an \"epic\" fraud. Do Kwon, a South Korean national, was co-founder of Singapore-based Terraform Labs, which developed the TerraUSD and Luna digital coins. Kwon had admitted misleading investors about TerraUSD, a so-called stablecoin that was supposed to maintain its value against the US dollar. He was one of a number of crypto bosses to face charges in the US after digital tokens slumped in 2022, triggering the failure of several companies. US District Judge Paul A Engelmayer, who handed down the sentence, said the Stanford graduate had repeatedly lied to investors who trusted him with their money. \"This was a fraud on an epic, generational scale,\" he said during Thursday's court hearing in Manhattan. \"In the history of federal prosecutions, there are few frauds that have caused as much harm as you have.\" Kwon - who pleaded guilty in August to conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud - expressed remorse to the judge. \"I have spent almost every waking moment of the last few years thinking of what I could have done different and what I can do now to make things right,\" he said. Prosecutors alleged that when TerraUSD fell below its $1 peg in May 2021, Kwon told investors that a computer algorithm had restored its value. Instead, Kwon had arranged for a trading firm to secretly buy millions of dollars of the coin to artificially boost its value, according to court documents.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Reddit has launched a challenge in Australia's highest court against the nation's landmark social media ban for children. The online forum is among 10 social media platforms which must bar Australians aged under 16 from having accounts, under a new law which began on Wednesday. The ban, which is being watched closely around the world, was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms. Reddit is complying with the ban, but in its case will argue that the policy has serious implications for privacy and political rights. It is the second such legal challenge, with two Australian teens also awaiting a High Court hearing. \"Despite the best intentions, this law is missing the mark,\" Reddit said in an update on its website. \"There are more effective ways for the Australian government to accomplish our shared goal of protecting youth.\" Australia's Communications Minister Anika Wells has previously said the government will not be swayed by legal threats. \"We will not be intimidated by big tech. On behalf of Australian parents, we will stand firm,\" she told parliament after news of the first legal challenge broke last month. In that case, which the High Court has agreed to consider at an as-yet undecided date next year, two 15-year-olds from New South Wales are claiming the social media ban is unconstitutional as it infringes \"the implied freedom of communication on governmental and political matters\". \"Democracy doesn't start at 16 as this law says it will,\" Macey Newland told the BBC after their case was filed. The ban, which has excited global leaders and worried tech companies, has also been criticised by some who argue blanket prohibition is neither practical nor wise. Experts fear kids are going to circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that's performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather. And backed by some mental health advocates, many children have argued it robs young people of connection - particularly those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities - and will leave them less equipped to tackle the realities of life on the web. But the policy is wildly popular with parents and has won the support of people like talk show host Oprah Winfrey, and Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. In a statement on their website, the pair lauded the \"bold\" action from Australia but said \"it shouldn't have come to this\". \"We hope this ban is only the start of a reckoning between society and the tech companies that built these platforms with growth as their first principle instead of safety.\" Various governments, from the US state of Florida to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest. Reddit said the law forces \"intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors\", isolates teens engaging in \"age-appropriate community experiences\" and creates an \"illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren't\". \"There are more targeted, privacy-preserving measures to protect young people online without resorting to blanket bans.\" The case is not \"an attempt to avoid compliance\" or \"an effort to retain young users for business reasons\", it added. \"Unlike other platforms included under this law, the vast majority of Redditors are adults, we don't market or target advertising to children under 18,\" it said. The other platforms affected by the ban include Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok.",

Instead, the magazine has recognised the year's most influential figure as \"the architects\" of artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia boss Jensen Huang, Meta head Mark Zuckerberg, X owner Elon Musk and AI \"godmother\" Fei-Fei Li are among those depicted on one of the magazine's two covers. Experts say it highlights how quickly AI, and the firms behind it, are reshaping society. It comes as a boom in the technology, ushered in by OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, continues at pace. Its boss Sam Altman said in September its chatbot is used by around 800 million people every week. Big tech firms are pouring billions of dollars into AI and the infrastructure behind it in a bid to stay ahead of rivals. There are two covers this year - one a piece of art depicting the letters AI surrounded by workers, and another a painting focused on the tech leaders themselves. Time The cover references the classic New York photograph \"Lunch atop a Skyscraper\" - but with tech figures in place of ironworkers At Meta, Zuckerberg has reportedly focused the firm around the tech, including its AI chatbot, which it has embedded in its popular apps. He, along with Huang, Musk, Li and Altman, appeared on the cover alongside Lisa Su, boss of chipmaker AMD, Anthropic chief Dario Amodei, and Google's AI lab lead Sir Demis Hassabis. \"This year, the debate about how to wield AI responsibly gave way to a sprint to deploy it as fast as possible,\" Time said as it announced its new covers. \"But the risk-averse are no longer in the driver's seat. \"Thanks to Huang, Son, Altman, and other AI titans, humanity is now flying down the highway, all gas no brakes, toward a highly automated and highly uncertain future.\" And the magazine's editor-in-chief Sam Jacobs said \"no one\" had as great an impact in 2025 than \"the individuals who imagined, designed, and built AI\". \"Humanity will determine AI's path forward, and each of us can play a role in determining AI's structure and future,\" he said. Time Forrester analyst Thomas Husson said 2025 could be seen as a \"tipping point\" for how frequently AI is now used in our day-to-day lives. \"Most consumers use it without even being aware of it,\" he told the BBC. He said AI is now being crammed into hardware, software and services - meaning it its uptake is \"much faster than during the Internet or mobile revolutions\". Some people now choose chatbots over search engines and social media to plan holidays , find Christmas gifts and discover recipes . Others, such as those worried about its energy use, training data and impact on their livelihoods, are opting-out entirely. Nik Kairinos, founder and chief executive of lab Fountech AI, said the covers were \"an honest assessment\" of the tech's influence, but he felt \"recognition should not be confused with readiness\". \"At this moment, AI can still be a saviour or scourge to humanity,\" he said. \"We are still in the early stages of building AI systems that are dependable, accountable, and aligned with human values. \"For those of us developing the technology and bringing AI tools to market, there is huge responsibility.\" Groups recognised over individuals Getty Images Steve Jobs was one of the tech founders representing the computer in 1982 This isn't the first time the Person of the Year has been a large group, with Ebola fighters being handed it in 2014 and whistleblowers in 2002. Previously, in 1982, it recognised the computer, with the magazine saying Americans had a \"giddy passion\" for the device. Time called it \"partly fad\", but said it was also \"partly a sense of how life could be made better\". The computer was represented by a number of tech entrepreneurs of the time, including Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and IBM president John Opel. Then in 2006, the Person of the Year was given to \"You\" - intended to represent the power of individuals online. Wikipedia contributors, early YouTubers and MySpace users were noted as examples of \"the many wresting power from the few and helping one another for nothing\". It continued: \"That will not only change the world, but also change the way the world changes.\"",

On 4 December Ofcom announced the £1m fine of AVS Group Ltd , which runs a number of pornographic websites, for not having good enough age verification methods. An Ofcom spokesperson said since the decision, AVS has implemented an \"age assurance method on certain websites\" that is \"capable of being highly effective at correctly determining whether or not a user is a child\". It added the group could still incur fines of £1,000 per day, until the body was \"satisfied\" with the changes it made across all of its platforms. Ofcom had also fined AVS an extra £50,000 for not responding to its emails since its investigation began in July. When asked if it had since heard from AVS, the regulator said it could not comment on an ongoing open investigation. After last week's £1m fine was announced, BBC News contacted a company called TubeCorporate, the adult content publishing platform behind AVS group Ltd sites, for a response, but is yet to receive one. The address which the firm uses is in the central American country Belize, and appears to be the registered address of a large number of companies - although it does not have physical offices there. The UK's Online Safety Act makes it a legal requirement for websites that host pornographic material to put in place what the regulator determines to be \"highly effective age assurance\" to prevent children from being able to easily access explicit content. Tougher age checks for porn websites were introduced in July, though some people have pointed out these could be easily avoided with a virtual private network (VPN), which reroutes internet traffic via a different country. A recent Ofcom report into the UK's media habits found VPN usage more than doubled after the start of age check requirements, rising from roughly 650,000 daily users before July and peaking at over 1.4 million in mid-August.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Shares of cloud computing giant Oracle plunged on Thursday, after weaker-than-expected revenues stoked concerns about returns from massive spending on artificial intelligence. The company's shares sank 14% after it had reported revenue of $16.1bn (£12bn) for the three months to November on Wednesday, compared with the $16.2bn projected by analysts. Revenue growth was still up 14%, with a 68% surge in sales at its AI business, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), the company said. OCI services AI developers whose demand for Oracle's AI infrastructure helped the company's shares reach new highs in recent months. But the results failed to quell fears about a potential AI bubble. In September, Oracle agreed a highly sought-after contract with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which agreed to purchase $300bn in computing power from Oracle over five years. Oracle chairman and chief technology officer Larry Ellison briefly became the world's richest man after the announcement. The firm's shares have lost 40% of their value since peaking three months ago, although they are still up by more than a third since the start of the year. In a statement issued on Wednesday, Mr Ellison struck a cautious tone. \"There are going to be a lot of changes in AI technology over the next few years and we must remain agile in response to those changes,\" he wrote. Mr Ellison also appeared to snub Nvidia, the designer of highly-sophisticated AI chips, saying Oracle would buy chips from any maker in order to serve clients. \"We will continue to buy the latest GPUs from Nvidia, but we need to be prepared and able to deploy whatever chips our customers want to buy,\" Mr Ellison declared in a policy he called \"chip neutrality\". Oracle's earnings also pulled down shares in other AI-related technology companies on Thursday. Nvidia's stock fell more than 3.5%, while shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) were nearly 4% lower. Oracle is involved in multiple AI infrastructure arrangements that have raised the prospect that major players in the sector are participating in \"circular financing\" deals whereby companies finance purchases of their own products and services. \"Oracle's earnings arrive as investors weigh whether its massive OpenAI partnership might mean overexposure with a customer currently in the spotlight over profitability concerns,\" said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne following the release of the company's quarterly report. Mr Bourne said Oracle faced mounting scrutiny over the increased debt the company has amassed to fund building data centres. Colleen McHugh, consultant to investment platform Wealthify, said the big questions being asked are whether tech stocks are overvalued and will the AI bubble burst, and given this the share price movement was not surprising. \"It's telling us that many of these tech stocks are priced for absolute perfection, and when there's a revenue miss – which was a small revenue miss to be fair by Oracle yesterday - they do get penalised,\" she told the BBC's Today programme. Others said Wall Street's negative reaction was unfounded. \"This was nothing but a great quarter for Oracle,\" said Cory Johnson, chief market strategist at Epistrophy Capital Research. \"Revenue growth of 14% is accelerating.\" Including the OpenAI deal from September, Mr Johnson noted, Oracle has signed $385bn in contracts over six months, and \"those new clients are the likes of Meta and Nvidia\". \"But AI sentiment is so bad right now, that's seen as a bad thing for Oracle,\" he added. Oracle raised a record $18bn in a massive bond sale in September, one of the largest debt issuances ever in the tech sector. \"Although Oracle's shares are buoyed by its September surge, this revenue miss will likely exacerbate concerns among already cautious investors about its OpenAI deal and its aggressive AI spending,\" Mr Bourne said. The Ellison family, supporters of US President Donald Trump, also recently purchased Paramount and have spearheaded a bid to take over another major Hollywood studio, Warner Brothers Discovery .",

      "summary_tr_long": "McDonald's Netherlands pulls AI Christmas ad after backlash Laura Cress Technology reporter McDonalds An AI-generated image from the McDonald's Netherlands advert McDonald's Netherlands has taken down a Christmas advert made with Artificial Intelligence (AI) following online backlash. The 45-second advert was produced with generative AI clips and released publicly on McDonald's Netherlands YouTube channel on 6 December. Viewers on social media denounced the use of AI in the film, with one commenter calling it \"the most god-awful ad I've seen this year\" . On 9 December McDonald's Netherlands removed the video, adding in a statement to BBC News that the moment served as \"an important learning\" as the company explored \"the effective use of AI\". The advert was created for McDonald's Netherlands by Dutch company TBWA\\Neboko and US production company The Sweetshop. Adverts which include generative AI have become a growing trend among major brands, such as Coca-Cola, particularly for the Christmas season. The McDonald's Netherlands advert depicted things that can go wrong during the Christmas break, using the slogan \"the most terrible time of the year\", and suggesting the time was better spent in the company of the fast food giant. Following its release, viewers criticised the film's uncanny-looking characters and large number of stitched together clips, calling it \"creepy\" and \"poorly edited\". As clips made using generative AI are more likely to distort the longer they run for - most clips made using the process tend to be roughly six to 10 seconds long - even a 45-second advert would likely consist of many videos edited together. The video also provoked concerns for job displacement in the industry, with one Instagram comment noting: \"No actors, no camera team..welcome to the future of filmmaking. And it sucks.\" 'Thousands of takes' Following the video being made private on the McDonald's Netherlands YouTube channel, The Sweetshop's chief executive Melanie Bridge defended the advert. As quoted in Futurism , she said the production process took \"seven weeks\" where the team \"hardly slept\" and created \"thousands of takes - then shaped them in the edit just as we would on any high-craft production\". \"It was a film.\" In a statement to BBC News, McDonald's Netherlands said the video was meant to \"reflect the stressful moments that can occur during the holidays\" but had decided to remove the advert. \"This moment serves as an important learning as we explore the effective use of AI,\" it said. Where normally a high-publicity Christmas campaign could take up to a year to pull off, companies have begun to look to firms which can produce films in a much shorter time span, using prompts from generative AI tools to create new video content. Coca-Cola seems to have been able to sway at least some of the general public with its second AI-generated Christmas ad in a row. While the use of AI to create the advert has been divisive, a report from analytics company Social Sprout found it had a 61% \"positive sentiment rating\" from commenters online. But several other businesses such as the Italian luxury fashion house Valentino have come under fire for using the technique in their campaigns, with critics calling Valentino's advert \"cheap\" and \"lazy\". BBC News has contacted The Sweetshop and TBWA\\Neboko for comment.",

He adds that one client, a hotel chain in the US, is planning to use heat from hotel servers to warm guest rooms, the hotel laundry and swimming pool. In November, a cooling system failure at a data centre in the US sent financial trading tech offline at CME Group, the world's largest exchange operator. The company has since put in place additional cooling capacity to help protect against a repeat of this incident. Currently, demand for data centres is booming, driven partly by the growth of AI technologies. But the huge amounts of energy and water that many of these facilities consume mean that they are increasingly controversial. More than 200 environmental groups in the US recently demanded a moratorium on new data centres in the country. So much so that many in the industry say traditional cooling methods – such as air cooling, where fans constantly blow air over the hottest components – is no longer sufficient for some operations. We don't have any fans whatsoever – we operate silently.\" Iceotope Iceotope says its tech can cut the cost of cooling by up to 80% Iceotope says its approach to liquid cooling, which can soothe multiple components in a data centre, not just the processing chips, may reduce cooling-related energy demands by up to 80%. The company's technology uses water to cool down the oil-based fluid that actually interacts with computer tech. But the water remains in a closed loop, so there is no need to continually draw more of it from local supplies. I ask whether the oil-based fluids in the firm's cooling system are derived from fossil fuel products and he says some of them are, though he stresses that none contain PFAS, also known as forever chemicals , which are harmful to human health. Some liquid-based data centre cooling technologies use refrigerants that do contain PFAS. Not only that, many refrigerants produce highly potent greenhouse gases, which threaten to exacerbate climate change. Two-phase cooling systems use such refrigerants says Yulin Wang, a former senior technology analyst at IDTechEx, a market research firm. The refrigerant starts out as a liquid but heat from server components causes it to evaporate into a gas and this phase change soaks up a lot of energy, meaning it is an effective way of cooling things down. In some designs, data centre tech is fully immersed in large quantities of PFAS-containing refrigerant. \"There could be some safety issues.\" In other cases, the refrigerant is piped directly to the hottest components, computer chips, only. Some companies that offer two-phase cooling are currently switching to PFAS-free refrigerants. Yulin Wang Yulin Wang warns of safety issues with some cooling chemicals Over the years, firms have experimented with wildly different approaches to cooling, in a race to find the best means of keeping data centre gadgets happy. The idea was that cold Scottish seawater would improve the efficiency of air-based cooling systems inside the device. But the company had learned much from it, says Alistair Speirs, general manager of global infrastructure in the Microsoft Azure business group. \"Without [human] operators, less things went wrong – that informed some of our operational procedures,\" he says. Initial findings showed the subsea data centre had a power usage effectiveness, or PUE, rating of 1.07 – suggesting it was far more efficient than the vast majority of land-based data centres. But in the end, Microsoft concluded that the economics of building and maintaining subsea data centres weren't very favourable. The company is still working on liquid-based cooling ideas, including microfluidics, where tiny channels of liquid flow through the many layers of a silicon chip. In July, Renkun Chen, at the University of California San Diego, and colleagues, published a paper detailing their idea for a pore-filled membrane-based cooling technology that could help to cool chips passively – without the need to actively pump fluids or blow air around. He compares it to the process by which water evaporates from a trees' leaves, inducing a pumping effect that draws more water up through the plant's trunk and along its branches to replenish the leaves. New ways of cooling down data centre tech are increasingly sought-after, says Sasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead at Hugging Face, a machine learning company. This is partly due to demand for AI – including generative AI, or large language models (LLMs), which are the systems that power chat bots. \"If you have models that are very energy-intensive, then the cooling has to be stepped up a notch,\" she says. Dr Luccioni calls for greater transparency from AI companies regarding how much energy their various products consume. For Mr Ballon, LLMs are just one form of AI – and he argues they have already \"reached their limit\" in terms of productivity.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Ben Morris Technology of Business Editor Tunnock's robot packaging A stream of hot caramel runs through the Thomas Tunnock factory just outside Glasgow. From the second floor where it is made, it runs along conveyor belts down to the first floor, bringing a a sweet, warm aroma to the building. Experienced workers have to check that it is at the right consistency, and it takes a team of 12 to spread the caramel in five layers that make up the Tunnock's wafer biscuit. \"We're making roughly 20 tonnes of caramel a day,\" says Stuart Louden, the firm's engineering and transport manager, and the fifth generation of the Tunnock family to work at the business. So basically, they walk up to the caramel and just give it a squeeze.\" Once made, a conveyor belt takes the caramel down to the floor below, where the spreading team works. \"Spreading caramel onto wafers is very, very difficult because it's so sticky,\" says Mr Louden. Stuart Louden balances tradition and efficiency at Tunnock's While this is a labour intensive part of the Tunnock's operation, most of the rest of the factory is automated. The company has always tried to use the latest technology to help keep up with the competition. \"We are a small fish in a big pond, and to try and keep up with some of these bigger companies that we are competing against, you've got to have the good machines there to get the output,\" says Mr Louden. They do have machines to spread the caramel, which work at night, but the human workforce is more flexible and takes up less space. Between them, the machines and humans turn out around seven million wafer bars and 4.5 million tea cakes a year. Raising output can be a balancing act for the firm, between maintaining their traditions and increasing output. For example, like their caramel production, Tunnock's marshmallow is made under close human supervision. Meanwhile, the wrapping of the wafer bar is folded around the product, rather than sealed at the ends. If you give people a caramel wafer, and somebody's not had one for 20 or 30, years, they go, 'I remember having one of these when I was a kid'.\" The makers of a new robot arm for the cake industry are hoping to bridge that gap between speed and tradition. Canada's Unifiller, part of Coperion a big maker of equipment for food production, spent years developing a robot arm, called HIRO. then it will go through our equipment and the the decorating tips,\" says Derek Lanoville, the research and development manager at Coperion. But making equipment for the food industry involves extra challenges - perhaps the biggest being hygiene. The bottom line is, if it's not easy to take apart, you don't clean it.\" Unifiller's robot arm comes from Swiss robotics firm Stäubli, which could supply an arm that's easy to clean. On production lines in most industries components will be the same size, often to within fractions of a millimetre. That's not the case in baking, where the cakes rolling down a line will be different - not by much - but enough,perhaps, to upset a robot. Sourdough loaves at The Bread Factory are shaped by hand For Anomarel Ogen, human hands are still essential to the baking process. Mr Ogen is head baker at The Bread Factory, which is where products for the café chain Gail's are baked. Their bakery in northwest London runs 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, supplying sourdough loaves to Gail's, as well as supermarkets, shops and restaurants. It uses around 16 tonnes of flour to produce up to 40,000 loaves a day, which sounds like a lot but, compared with the giant bakers, is still a medium-sized business. They use a range of flours that are farmed using sustainable methods that prioritise soil health. \"Look at his hands, and look how gentle he actually is with the movement, how little pressure he is actually putting in. If the recipe is tweaked, they can monitor the impact that has on the dough and change the baking process, if necessary. \"You can automate more, but you still need to put in gatekeeping right along the path, to make sure that you can safeguard the process,\" says Mr Ogen. The Bread Factory produces up to 40,000 sourdough loaves a day Introducing new tech to a production line is always a balance, says Craig Le Clair, principal analyst at the research firm Forrester, and also the author of Random Acts of Automation: How to Fight Back When Automation Threatens Your Work, Your Life, and Everything You Do. \"The key in food as well as other industries is developing a hybrid model that integrates automation without losing the \"soul\" of a handcrafted product, like a decorated cake. \"Process transformation must apply automation only to areas that benefit from consistency, speed, and volume, while keeping core value-add elements strictly human,\" he says. \"What we're focused on this year is really nailing down our scanning, vision and and safety systems so that, so that our our customers can work the way that they work, without the robot being intrusive.\" Meanwhile in Glasgow, Mr Louden has plans to upgrade his production line, but much hinges on the financial environment. \"When it comes to investing another two-and-a-half million pounds in equipment, we just need to wait, because the last couple of years just have not been the right time, and we don't want to put ourselves financially in a position that it could hurt us.\" More Technology of Business",

      "summary_tr_long": "Meet the biggest heat pumps in the world Chris Baraniuk Technology Reporter MVV Energie MVV Energie is building the world's most powerful heat pump systems The pipe that will supply the heat pump, drawing water from the River Rhine in Germany, is so big that you could walk through it, fully upright, I'm told. \"We plan to take 10,000 litres per second,\" says Felix Hack, project manager at MVV Environment, an energy company, as he describes the 2m diameter pipes that will suck up river water in Mannheim, and then return it once heat from the water has been harvested. In October, parent firm MVV Energie announced its plan to build what could be the most powerful heat pump modules ever. Two units, each with a capacity of 82.5 megawatts. That's enough to supply around 40,000 homes, in total, via a district heating system. MVV Energie aims to build the system on the site of a coal power plant that is converting to cleaner technologies. The scale of the heat pumps was determined partly by limits on the size of machinery that could be transported through the streets of Mannheim, or potentially via barges along the Rhine. \"It might come via the river.\" One person well aware of the project is Alexandre de Rougemont, at Everllence (formerly MAN Energy Solutions), another German company that also makes extremely large heat pumps. This same process occurs in heat pumps designed to supply single homes, it just happens on a much larger scale in giant heat pumps that serve entire city districts. \"There was a lot of pressure on us to change the heat generation to new sources, especially renewable sources,\" explains Mr Hack as he discusses the decommissioning of coal-fired units at the Mannheim plant. The site is right by the Rhine, already has a hefty electricity grid connection, and is plugged in to the district heating network, so it makes sense to install the heat pumps here, he says. He notes that the technology is possible partly thanks to the availability of very large compressors in the oil and gas industry – where they are used to compress fossil fuels for storage or transportation, for example. MVV Energie The new heat pump at Mannheim will transfer heat from the Rhine Work on the Mannheim project is due to start next year. The heat pumps – with a combined capacity of 162MW – are set to become fully operational in the winter of 2028-29. Mr Hack adds that a multi-step filter system will prevent the heat pumps sucking up fish from the river, and that modelling suggests the system will affect the average temperature of the river by less than 0.1C. The Mannheim heat pump setup will cost €200m ($235m; £176m). Mr de Rougemont at Everllence says that, at his company, heat-pump equipment costs roughly €500,000 per megawatt of installed capacity – this does not include the additional cost of buildings, associated infrastructure and so on. Everllence Everllence has plans for heat pumps even bigger than this one in Esberg Everllence is currently working on a project in Aalborg, Denmark that will be even more powerful than the system in Mannheim, with a total capacity of 176MW. It will use smaller modules, however – four 44MW units – and is due to become operational in 2027, when it will supply nearly one third of all heating demand in the town. Those 44MW machines are actually the same ones used in a previous project, now fully operational, to the south of Aalborg in Esbjerg. There, they don't run at maximum capacity but rather supply 35MW each. Large hot water storage tanks, each able to hold 200,000 cubic metres of liquid, will give the system added flexibility, adds Mr de Rougemont: \"When the electricity price is high, you stop your heat pump and only provide heat from the storage.\" Veronika Wilk at the Austrian Institute of Technology says, \"Heat pumps and district heating systems are a great fit.\" Such systems can harvest heat from bodies of water or even wastewater from sewage treatment plants. Getty Images Helsinki is overhauling its district heating system All the systems mentioned so far harvest energy from water sources but, less commonly, very large heat pumps can use the air as a heat source, too. \"We calculated that we would need to build a tunnel more than 20km long to the ocean, to get enough water [with a] temperature high enough.\" Helsinki is in the process of radically overhauling its district heating system. The city has added heat pumps, biomass burners and electric boilers to a 1,400km network that links up nearly 90% of buildings in the Finnish capital, adds Mr Aaltonen. Heat pumps convert single kilowatt hours of electricity into multiple kilowatt hours of heat but electric boilers can't do this and are therefore considered less efficient. I ask why Helen Oy decided to install hundreds of megawatts of these boilers and Mr Aaltonen says that they are cheaper to install than heat pumps and having them also means he and colleagues don't have to rely entirely on the air, which is limited in terms of how much heat it can provide at scale. There are no heat pumps in the UK that rival the systems under development in Denmark, Germany and Finland. The minimum planned capacity of the network is 12MW. It will feature three 4MW air-to-water heat pumps, with the first unit due to become operational in 2028. Keith Baker at Glasgow Caledonian University, who researches district heating systems, says the UK has opportunities to make more of this technology.",

      "summary_tr_long": "'It's amazing' – the wonder material very few can make Chris Baraniuk Technology Reporter Kromek Very few organisations can supply cadmium zinc telluride Lying on your back in a big hospital scanner, as still as you can, with your arms above your head – for 45 minutes. That's what patients at Royal Brompton Hospital in London had to do during certain lung scans, until the hospital installed a new device last year that cut these examinations down to just 15 minutes. It is partly thanks to image processing technology in the scanner but also a special material called cadmium zinc telluride (CZT), which allows the machine to produce highly detailed, 3D images of patients' lungs. \"You get beautiful pictures from this scanner,\" says Dr Kshama Wechalekar, head of nuclear medicine and PET. \"It's an amazing feat of engineering and physics.\" The CZT in the machine, which was installed at the hospital last August, was made by Kromek – a British company. Kromek is one of just a few firms in the world that can make CZT. You may never have heard of the stuff but, in Dr Wechalekar's words, it is enabling a \"revolution\" in medical imaging. This wonder material has many other uses, such as in X-ray telescopes, radiation detectors and airport security scanners. Investigations of patients' lungs performed by Dr Wechalekar and her colleagues involve looking for the presence of many tiny blood clots in people with long Covid, or a larger clot known as a pulmonary embolism, for example. The £1m scanner works by detecting gamma rays emitted by a radioactive substance that is injected into patients' bodies. But the scanner's sensitivity means less of this substance is needed than before: \"We can reduce doses about 30%,\" says Dr Wechalekar. While CZT-based scanners are not new in general, large, whole-body scanners such as this one are a relatively recent innovation. Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust Dr Kshama Wechalekar with the latest scanner at London's Royal Brompton Hospital CZT itself has been around for decades but it is notoriously difficult to manufacture. \"It has taken a long time for it to develop into an industrial-scale production process,\" says Arnab Basu, founding chief executive of Kromek. In the company's facility at Sedgefield, there are 170 small furnaces in a room that Dr Basu describes as looking \"like a server farm\". \"Atom by atom, the crystals are rearranged […] so they become all aligned,\" says Dr Basu. The newly formed CZT, a semiconductor, can detect tiny photon particles in X-rays and gamma rays with incredible precision – like a highly specialised version of the light-sensing, silicon-based image sensor in your smartphone camera. Whenever a high energy photon strikes the CZT, it mobilises an electron and this electrical signal can be used to make an image. It retains all the important information such as timing, the energy of the X-ray that is hitting the CZT detector – you can create colour, or spectroscopic images.\" He adds that CZT-based scanners are currently in use for explosives detection at UK airports, and for scanning checked baggage in some US airports. \"We expect CZT to come into the hand luggage segment over the next [few] years.\" Kromek Special furnaces are needed to make CZT But it's not always easy to get your hands on CZT. Henric Krawczynski at Washington University in St Louis in the US has used the material before on space telescopes attached to high altitude balloons. These detectors can pick up X-rays emitted by both neutron stars and plasma around black holes. Prof Krawczynski wants very thin, 0.8mm pieces of CZT for his telescopes because this helps to reduce the amount of background radiation they pick up, allowing for a clearer signal. \"We'd like to buy 17 new detectors,\" he says. \"It's really difficult to get these thin ones.\" He was unable to source the CZT from Kromek. \"We support many, many research organisations,\" he adds, \"It's very difficult for us to do a hundred different things. Each research [project] needs a very particular type of detector structure.\" For Prof Krawczynski, it's not a crisis – he says he might use either CZT that he has from previous research, or cadmium telluride, an alternative, for his next mission. That upcoming mission was due to fly from Antarctica in December but \"all the dates are in flux\", says Prof Krawczynski, because of the US government shutdown . Diamond Light Source CZT will be used in an upgrade of Diamond Light Source Many other scientists use CZT. In the UK, a major upgrade of the Diamond Light Source research facility in Oxfordshire – costing half a billion pounds – will improve its capabilities thanks to the installation of CZT-based detectors. Diamond Light Source is a synchrotron, which fires electrons around a giant ring at nearly the speed of light. Magnets cause these whizzing electrons to lose some energy in the form of X-rays, and these are directed off from the ring in beamlines so that they may be used to analyse materials, for example. With Diamond Light Source's upgrade, due to complete in 2030, the X-rays produced will be significantly brighter, meaning that existing sensors would not be able to detect them properly. \"There's no point in spending all this money in upgrading these facilities if you can't detect the light they produce,\" says Matt Veale, group leader for detector development at the Science and Technology Facilities Council, a stakeholder in the Diamond Light Source. That's why, here too, CZT is the material of choice.",

      "summary_tr": "Mr Logtenberg is the co-founder of CEAD, a company that designs and builds large-format 3D printers at its base in the Dutch town of Delft. And in the 12 months since they have been operating the Marine Application Centre in Delft, they have already built a prototype 12m fast boat, similar to a RIB, for the Dutch Navy. How far could 3D printing go in the maritime world?",
      "summary_tr_long": "Will boats be a breakthrough for 3D printing tech? After two years of experimentation, the material was finally right: a particular mix of thermoplastics and fibreglass that is strong, has no need of extra coating to protect it from sunlight, and is resistant to fouling and marine growth. The perfect base, says Mr Logtenberg, from which to 3D print a boat. But after months of tweaking the chemistry, it took just four days for the first hull to roll off the printer at the new factory that Mr Logtenberg and his colleagues run. \"We're automating almost 90% of the boat-building process, and in superfast time,\" he says. We print one now every week.\" It's the kind of story that 3D printing has long promised. Those promises haven't always been fulfilled – but Mr Logtenberg is convinced that the maritime sector is one where 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, can play a transformational role. Mr Logtenberg is the co-founder of CEAD, a company that designs and builds large-format 3D printers at its base in the Dutch town of Delft. Until now, its business has been to provide the printers for others to use, but with boatbuilding CEAD decided to get involved in production as well. \"3D printed boats still need to be accepted by the market,\" says Mr Logtenberg. [So] instead of just building machines, we're going to do it ourselves.\" CEAD The printer builds the boat one layer at a time Traditional fibreglass boat building requires a mould and considerable manual work to make sure the vessel is of the required strength. In additive manufacturing, the work has already been done at the design stage, in creating the software and the printer itself (which is labour intensive). 3D printers work by building up tiny layers of the basic material, to a predetermined digital design. In the production phase, as long as there is a supply of the base material, there is little or no need for human intervention. Much 3D printing operates on a relatively small scale – dentistry is one area where it has made a major impact. CEAD's largest 3D printer is nearly 40m (131ft) long, and has been used by a customer in Abu Dhabi to print an electric ferry. And in the 12 months since they have been operating the Marine Application Centre in Delft, they have already built a prototype 12m fast boat, similar to a RIB, for the Dutch Navy. \"Normally when the Navy buys a boat, it takes them years before they receive it and they pay quite some money,\" says Mr Logtenberg. And we can learn from it and build another one in six weeks and even recycle the first one.\" Another fast growth area is the use of unmanned vessels – nautical drones. CEAD recently took part in a test with Nato Special Forces in which drones were built on site in a matter of hours, with designs changing according to operational requirements. The ability to relocate production makes 3D printing incredibly flexible, according to Mr Logtenberg. \"It doesn't matter whether it's a 6m small work boat or a 12m military boat. \"The only transport we need to do is the base material, which comes in big bags and it's very transport efficient, compared to a boat.\" Matthew Kenyon Maarten Logtenberg stands with an 8m-long printed hull Raw Idea Raw Idea uses recycled plastic in the hulls of its boats Not far from CEAD, in the port city of Rotterdam, a company called Raw Idea and their 'Tanaruz' brand are looking at making a similar impact in the leisure market, especially rentals. \"Consumers are hesitant [because of the novelty], but the rental market is really keen,\" says Joyce Pont, Raw Idea's managing director. \"It's marketing, you can go to the socials and say, 'we've got a 3D printed boat', and everybody wants to look at and touch that boat.\" Another selling point is that Raw Idea uses a mix of glass fibre and recycled consumer plastics (fizzy drinks bottles and so on). That's one reason why the price is currently comparable to a traditionally-built boat, because recycled material costs more to buy. \"I'm convinced that in five years from now, 3D printed boats will take over the market for the fast-driving boat, like work boats, like speed boats,\" she tells me. Both RAW Idea and CEAD are engaging with European regulators almost in real time, as they use new materials and new ideas to produce vessels that cannot be compared to what has come before. 3D printing has often been hailed as a revolutionary technology but hasn't always delivered on those hopes. \"It's all being seen as one thing, but you have metal printing, you have polymer or large-scale printing, all these different applications. \"There are many applications that didn't succeed because it was not competitive enough, but there are a few where it actually happened and is being used.\" Additive manufacturing is being used more frequently in the shipping industry, but in technical niches, rather than entire hulls. How far could 3D printing go in the maritime world? Joyce Pont is sceptical whether that moment will arrive in the foreseeable future – she sees the building of superyachts and other such vessels as a 'craft' which will resist automation. \"Building a 12-meter boat, I never expected that a year ago,\" he says. It's going to take maybe a decade or two before we are going to completely print [a ship's hull], because there will be more need of material research.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Scammers hacked her phone and stole thousands - so how did they get her details? Joe Tidy Cyber correspondent, BBC World Service Getty Images Data breaches are getting so common that it can be hard to know how to react when it happens to you. Being a victim of a data breach increases your chances of being targeted by criminals and scammers. Sue told the BBC how scammers went after her. Sue had her digital life hijacked by scammers She was a victim of what's known as a Sim swap attack - where scammers trick a network operator into thinking they're the account holder to get a new Sim card for a mobile device. \"The scammers took over my Gmail account and then locked me out of my bank accounts because they failed security checks,\" she said. Sue also had a credit card opened in her name and the criminals purchased more than £3,000 in vouchers. It took several trips to the branches of her bank and mobile phone provider to get her accounts back. \"The criminals also did a sinister thing after breaking into my WhatsApp,\" she said. \"They sent messages to horse riding groups I am in warning there were people on their way to stab the horses.\" We searched hacker databases using online tools like haveibeenpwned.com and Constella Intelligence to see if Sue's details were previously compromised. Her phone number, email address, date of birth and physical address were all exposed in data breaches at gambling platform PaddyPower in 2010 and email validation tool Verifications.io in 2019. Hannah Baumgaertner, from cyber firm Silobreaker, said attackers likely used the personal data leaked in previous breaches to conduct the Sim swap attack. \"Once they had access to Sue's phone number they were were able to intercept any security codes sent to verify her identity for her Gmail account,\" she said. Fran from Brazil told the BBC she found a user had registered to her Netflix account - and increased her monthly subscription. \"I was charged $9.90 (£7.50) on my payment card, even though I hadn't made this purchase,\" she said. \"I immediately contacted my family to find out if anyone had added another profile to the account we share, but they all said no.\" Fran was a victim of a common scam where her Netflix account was hijacked by a freeloader. It's not known exactly how they got into her account and the murky world of cybercrime means it is difficult to pinpoint if a single data breach led to someone being scammed. But we found Fran's email address had been exposed in at least four data breaches including hacks of Internet Archive (2024), Trellov (2024), Descomplica (2021) and Wattpad (2020) according to the website haveibeenpwned.com. The password she used for her Netflix account is not in publicly known databases but might be in others. \"There is a huge market for cracked Netflix, Disney and Spotify accounts\", said Alon Gal, co founder of cyber security company Hudson Rock. \"It's a low-barrier entry point for cybercrime, turning one company's data leak into widespread, ongoing abuse.\" Scammers often combine stolen private information with public information. Leah, who didn't want to give her real name, runs a small business using Facebook adverts and was recently targeted in a long running scam apparently originating from Vietnam. I clicked on the link and entered my details on the fake Meta page and the scammers were able to take over my business account even though I had 2 factor authentication. \"They then posted child sexual abuse videos under my name which got me blocked. I was even barred from using Messenger to complain to Meta.\" In the three days it took Leah to get back her business account back the scammers had run hundreds of pounds of adverts paid for by her. Alberto Casares from Constella Intelligence searched hacker databases and found Leah's email address and other details were taken in data breaches at Gravatar (2020) and this year's Qantas (third-party breach). \"It looks like the attackers used a common technique of linking up Leah's private stolen email address with her publicly listed business number to launch a targeted phishing attack against the email account.\" They could have done this themselves or used a data broker to pay for a number of potential targets he said. Mass data breaches Mass data breaches are fuelling scams and secondary hacks around the world, with several high profile attacks coming in 2025 alone. According to Proton Mail's Data Breach Observatory, there have been 794 verified breaches from identifiable sources discovered so far in 2025 with more than 300 million individual records exposed. \"Criminals pay premium prices for stolen data because it consistently generates profit through fraud, extortion, and cyberattacks,\" said Eamonn Maguire from the firm. Aside from notifying customers and regulators about breaches, there are no hard and fast rules on what companies should do for victims. Last year, Ticketmaster (which saw 500m people affected by a breach) offered this to some people. Marks and Spencer and Qantas, for example, have not offered these services to customers. Co-op chose to give victims a £10 voucher - if they spent £40 in its shops. Some are trying to seek compensation in the courts, with a growing trend of class action lawsuits - though these are notoriously hard to win because it is difficult to prove how individuals have been impacted. T-Mobile has begun paying customers affected by a major data breach in 2021 which affected 76m customers. The firm agreed to pay $350m - with payments reportedly ranging from $50 to $300.",

      "summary_tr_long": "\"It has potential for extraordinary benefits - we will have to work through societal disruptions.\" But the confusing question lingering over the AI hype is whether it is a bubble at risk of bursting - as, if so, it may well be a spectacular burst akin to the dotcom crash at the start of the century, with consequences for us all. Bloomberg via Getty Images A walkway runs along the length of Googleplex, passing by a giant dinosaur skeleton, a beach volleyball pitch and staff lunching in the winter sun The Bank of England has already warned of a \"sudden correction\" in global financial markets, saying \"market valuations appear stretched\" for tech AI firms. Asked whether Google would be immune from a potential bubble burst, Mr Pichai said it could weather that potential storm - but for all his starry-eyed excitement around the possibilities of AI, he also issued a warning: \"I think no company is going to be immune, including us.\" So why, then, is Google investing more than $90bn a year in the AI build-out, a three-fold increase in just four years, at the very moment these suggestions are being discussed? Chipmaker turned AI systems pioneer Nvidia in Santa Clara is now worth more than $5 trillion. A 10-minute drive south, in Cupertino, is Apple HQ, hovering around $4 trillion; while 15 minutes west is $1.9 trillion Meta (previously Facebook). Google's parent firm Alphabet, headquartered in Mountain View, is worth about $3.3 trillion, and has almost doubled in value since April, (which every Googler on campus will no doubt be feeling through the value of their stock options) The purely financial consequences of this trend are significant enough. And that market value is now more highly concentrated in a few firms than it was during the dotcom bubble in 1999, according to the IMF. But he concedes: \"It's also true when we go through these investment cycles, there are moments we overshoot collectively as an industry… \"So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.\" Sundar Pichai: \"We have this phrase at Google, which is 'uncomfortably exciting'.\" Now, a distinction is emerging in the markets between those businesses that rely on often borrowed money and complicated deals to access the chips that power their AI, and the biggest tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which can fund investment in chips and data from their own pockets. The CPU (central processing unit) is the primary component of a computer - essentially its brain - that performs most of the processing and control functions, while GPUs (graphics processing units) perform more specialised processing, executing many parallel tasks at once - this can include AI. The TPUs are part of Sundar Pichai's overall strategy of owning the entire scientific supply chain - from the silicon to the data, plus the AI models and everything in between A core aspect of the AI boom has been the mad dash to amass lots of top-performing chips and put them into data centres (or the physical facilities that store, process and run large amounts of data and software). The chips race - and the OpenAI storm The terrace of the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel, a sprawling 16-acre estate near the Santa Cruz mountains that serves crab rolls and $35 signature vodka martinis, is where the big Silicon Valley deal-making gets done. Getty Images Sam Altman: 'What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure' In a podcast episode that aired last month, an OpenAI investor questioned how the company's spending commitments tallied with its revenues, to which co-founder Sam Altman shot back, challenging the revenue figures quoted, and adding: \"If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough.\" He has since shared a lengthy post on X, explaining, among other things, that OpenAI is looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next eight years and why he believes now is the time to invest in scaling up their technology. But he also said: \"What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure.\" Getty Images Elon Musk and Larry Ellison are said to have begged Nvidia's Jensen Huang to sell them more top-performing chips during a dinner in Nobu Elsewhere, there have been notable very recent falls in share prices of AI infrastructure companies - Coreweave, a start-up that supplies OpenAI, saw its shares lose 26% of their value earlier this month. ChatGPT versus Gemini 3.0 None of this has dampened the excitement over AI's potential within the industry. Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, launched to great fanfare earlier this week — this will pitch Google in a direct battle with OpenAI and its still-dominant ChatGPT for the market share. By 2030, data centres around the world will use about as much electricity as India did in 2023, according to the IMF. I put this to Google's Mr Pichai, asking if it is coherent to have ambitions to generate 95% of electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030 - as the UK government does - and also be an AI superpower? Take Amazon - its share price slumped to $6 and its market capitalisation fell to $4bn during that crash, yet some 25 years on Jeff Bezos and his company are very much going strong.

      "summary_tr_long": "On the front line of Europe's standoff with Russia's sanction-busting shadow fleet Jessica Parker, Berlin correspondent, Baltic Sea and Ned Davies, BBC Verify Getty Images The BBC joined coastguards on the front line of Europe's uneasy standoff with Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\" Out on the western Baltic, a coastguard officer radios a nearby, sanctioned oil tanker. After the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy, which Moscow is accused of dodging by shipping oil on aged tankers often with obscure ownership or insurance. European coastguards and navies are regularly coming in contact with vessels in Russia's shadow fleet which they suspect are transporting oil Some \"shadow\" ships are even suspected of undersea sabotage, illicit drone launches or \"spoofing\" their location data. As the BBC has learned, a growing network of \"shadow\" ships are sailing without a valid national flag, which can render vessels stateless and without proper insurance. That is a troubling trend, given many are practically \"floating rust buckets\", says senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI, Michelle Wiese Bockmann. Driven by record sanctions and tighter enforcement, the number of falsely flagged ships globally has more than doubled this year to over 450, most of them tankers, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) database. The BBC has been tracking one ship that appears to have sailed without a valid flag. The head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says that vessels travel back and forth, past Estonia, to major Russian oil terminals The head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says they have seen dozens of such passing vessels this year whereas they used to see just one or two. What's more, he suggests, it's brazen: \"There's no secret made about it.\" We spot the tanker Unity on the MarineTraffic app, the day we board an Estonian (British-built) Minehunter that is also used in Nato's Baltic Sentry patrols to protect critical infrastructure. Journeying east, Unity is over 100 miles away but sailing in our direction. The BBC has investigated its history and it offers an illuminating insight into the enigmatic life of a shadow ship. Tracking data shows that Unity has passed through the English Channel four times in the last twelve months, including journeys between Russian ports and India; a key oil customer that has not signed up to the price cap. Originally known as Ocean Explorer, the tanker was built in 2009 and flew the flag of Singapore for more than a decade. Back in 2019, it was named in a UN report for alleged involvement in a ship-to-ship transfer with a vessel that had been sanctioned for its role in transporting fuel to North Korea - which is among other countries also charged with utilising elusive shadow ships. By late 2021, the vessel – which that year operated under the name Ocean Vela – took the flag of the Marshall Islands but was struck from that list in 2024, a registry spokesperson told us, because the ship's then-operator and beneficial owning company had been sanctioned by the UK. The tanker appears to have had three further names since 2021 (Beks Swan, March and Unity) and three further flags (Panama, Russia and Gambia) but always retains a unique IMO number. Lesotho is a small, landlocked African enclave kingdom that, according to the IMO, does not have an official registry. Over the past year, Unity has made several voyages to and from Russian oil ports The BBC has tried to contact Unity's listed owner, a Dubai-registered company called FMTC Ship Charter LLC , but our emails and our calls went unanswered. The beneficial owners of 60% of shadow fleet vessels remain essentially unknown, according to maritime intelligence company Windward AI. By 6 November, it was anchored outside the Russian port of Ust-Luga where it remains at the time of publication. The tanker was added to the UK and EU's ever-growing list of sanctioned vessels earlier this year but, like so many others, continues to do business despite other difficulties. Planet Labs At the time of publication the vessel was anchored just outside the major Russian oil port, Ust-Luga Unity is just one of hundreds of vessels subject to UK and EU service and port bans as both London and Brussels try to increase pressure on the Kremlin. Nevertheless, Russian revenues from crude and oil product sales were $13.1bn (£9.95bn) in October alone, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) - although this was down by $2.3bn when compared with the same month a year ago. Analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air finds that \"shadow\" tankers, either sanctioned or suspected, account for 62% of shipped Russian crude oil exports, while China and India are by far the biggest customers for crude, followed by Turkey and the European Union itself. \"Every day in the Baltic, there's suspicious activity,\" a Nato official told the BBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \"You need to see it in a larger perspective,\" says investigator Jonatan Tholin when I suggest these measures appear less than muscular: \"This information can be used in our maritime surveillance.\" But as Europe steps up checks and watches the waves, Windward's Michelle Wiese Bockmann spies something else: \"You can literally see the international rules-based order crumbling through the sanctions-circumventing tactics of these vessels.\" There is a lot at stake for the environment and on security, she says, and meanwhile \"the dark fleet is getting darker\". The BBC approached Russia's embassy in London for comment. \"Labelling ships used to export Russian oil as 'shadow fleet' is discriminatory and misleading,\" the embassy said, and instances of invalid flags were typically down to \"easily resolved\" issues such as administrative delays.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Can technology fix fashion's sizing crisis? Shiona McCallum Senior technology reporter BBC Most women will relate to the misery of inconsistent sizing in high-street shops. A pair of jeans could easily be a size 10 by one brand and a size 14 in another, leaving customers confused and disheartened. It has led to a global deluge of returns, costing fashion retailers an estimated £190bn a year as would-be shoppers wonder what size they're meant to buy from which store. I didn't have to look far to find people experiencing the problem. \"I don't trust high-street sizing,\" one person tells me, as she browses one of London's popular shopping streets. \"To be honest, I buy by how it looks rather than the actual size.\" She's one of many women who often orders multiple versions of the same item to find one that fits, before sending the rest back, fuelling a culture of mass returns. A new generation of sizing tech A growing cluster of tech companies are now attempting to fix the problem. Tools such as 3DLook, True Fit and EasySize focus on helping customers choose the right size at checkout, using body scans via smartphone photos to suggest the most accurate fit. Meanwhile, virtual fitting-room platforms including Google's virtual try-on, Doji, Alta, Novus, DRESSX Agent and WEARFITS allow shoppers to create digital avatars and preview how items might look. These systems aim to increase confidence when buying online. More recently, AI-powered shopping agents have begun entering the market too. Daydream, allows users to describe what they are looking for and then recommends options. OneOff pulls together looks from celebrities to find similar items, while Phia scans tens of thousands of websites to compare prices and surface early \"size insights.\" While these tools work at the e-commerce stage, a new UK start-up, Fit Collective, is taking a different approach: trying to prevent the problem earlier in the production process. Founder Phoebe Gormley argues AI can potentially fix the sizing before clothes reach the stores. The 31-year-old - who is no data scientist, rather a tailor - previously launched Savile Row's first female tailors, making made-to-measure garments for a range of women. \"They would all come in and say, 'high-street sizing is so bad',\" she tells me. She says fashion's current model is a \"downward spiral\" where brands make cheaper garments to offset huge return rates, which leads to unhappy customers and more waste. Since launching last year, Fit Collective has raised £3 million in pre-seed funding, reportedly the largest amount ever secured by a solo female founder in the UK. \"As far as we know, we are the first solution comparing all the manufacturing data and the commercial data,\" she says. Phoebe's new venture uses machine learning to analyse a range of data - including returns, sales figures and customer emails - to really understand why something didn't fit. It then turns this into clear advice for design and production teams, who can adjust patterns, sizing and materials before manufacturing begins. Her system may tell a firm, for example, to take a few centimetres off the length of an item of clothing to reduce the number of returns overall. This saves money for the company and time for the consumer. Despite what the labels may say, it's clear these jeans aren't all the same size While many in the industry welcome such tools, some warn technology alone won't fix fashion's sizing problem. \"People aren't mannequins, they're unique, and so are their fit preferences,\" says Paul Alger, Director of International Business at the UK Fashion and Textile Association. He warns sizing can be nuanced, with body measurements rarely aligning with a number on a label. \"It's very difficult, it's very subjective,\" he says. \"Most of us are a different shape and size - around the world people have different body shapes.\" And then there's the issue of vanity sizing - or \"emotional sizing\" according to Mr Alger - where a brand will deliberately choose to create a more generous fit in the knowledge that a consumer, especially in women's wear, will prefer to shop there. \"Once these sizing norms are established in a collection, brands will usually refer back to them each season so they are effectively creating their own brand sizing,\" he says. Sophie De Salis, sustainability policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium, says retailers are increasingly aware of the issue, from a cost-saving and sustainability perspective. \"Smarter sizing tech and AI-driven solutions are key to reducing returns and supporting the industry's sustainability goals. BRC members are working with innovative tech providers to help their customers buy the most suitable size and reduce returns,\" she says. With returns now a board room issue and sustainability pressures mounting, more fashion houses may well consider data-driven design. While no single solution is likely to solve inconsistent sizing completely, the emergence of tools like Fit Collective, alongside a growing ecosystem of virtual try-ons and size-prediction platforms, suggests the industry is beginning to shift.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Call of Duty is back, and it's got a battle on its hands Tom Richardson, BBC Newsbeat and Mel Ramsay, BBC News Activision Actress Kiernan Shipka takes a central role in Black Ops 7's campaign There are some things you can always rely on, and a new Call of Duty game coming out each year is one of them. As one of the best-known names in video games, it's a series that needs little introduction. According to publisher Activision, it's sold an estimated 500 million copies, a movie adaptation is on the way, and despite having launched in 2003 it still reliably appears at - or near - the top of the annual bestseller charts. But this year the world's top military shooter might have a fight on its hands. Battlefield 6, which has been a huge hit for rival gaming giant Electronic Arts, has been drawing attention away from its veteran competitor. And long-time Call of Duty fans have been increasingly vocal over worries about the series losing touch with its roots. The clash of the multiplayer titans comes at an interesting time for the makers of Call of Duty, who've had to issue responses to fan concerns about the series losing its way . It has long offered players the chance to purchase \"operator skins\" that change their character's appearance. They're a frequent source of brand crossovers, and previous designs have been based on stars including footballer Neymar Jr, streamer NickMercs and rapper Nicki Minaj. But when Activision revealed skins based on 90s cartoon characters Beavis and Butthead earlier this year, there was a backlash. Fans accused the company of trying to mimic Fortnite, the ever-popular multiplayer game famous for its sometimes unlikely crossovers, which have included pop star Sabrina Carpenter and an AI-voiced Darth Vader in 2025 . Activision said the feedback from fans \"hit home\" and that it took the complaints about the series losing its identity seriously. It's also being released after parent company Microsoft increased prices of its Game Pass subscription service by 20% , angering many players. Activision Black Ops games thrust players into a world of espionage and conspiracy When BBC News sits down with lead producer Natalie Pohorski and senior comms director Stephanie Snowdon, they're keen to talk up Black Ops 7's single-player story campaign. The equivalent mode in Battlefield 6 was considered underwhelming by reviewers, and Call of Duty teams are renowned for their skill in crafting explosive set pieces in their narrative modes. Black Ops-themed installments of the series usually tell Hollywood blockbuster-style stories of secret agents uncovering vast conspiracies. Black Ops 7 is a direct sequel to 2012's Black Ops 2, set in 2035 and tells a story involving a global terrorist threat and a murky big tech company. Natalie says that the \"Black Ops identity\" allows the developers to explore themes that others can't. \"There's a lot of really interesting and timeless ideas... there's endless ways to explore them,\" she says. \"And then we ask a lot of questions that could apply to any era - questions of trust, can you believe what you're seeing?\" Activision Milo Ventimiglia takes over the role of hero David Mason Being one of the biggest names in gaming also allows Activision to attract some big-name talent to Call of Duty projects. For Black Ops 7, that includes Kiernan Shipka, best known for her role in Netflix's Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, and This Is Us star Milo Ventimiglia. Kiernan tells BBC News she's aware of Call of Duty's huge profile, and the expectations of its fans. She says being involved was \"honestly more exciting than anything.\" \"I love a fandom,\" she says. \"And I think that when something over time garners such passion from fans, that means you're stepping into something really cool. \"The reaction is going to be what the reaction is going to be. \"If I let that stuff in, that's not a good thing.\" As someone who played Call of Duty when he was younger, Milo says he's also aware of the standards fans have. \"I mean, I hope I don't muck it up for anybody,\" he says. Asked whether he thinks players are getting \"fatigued\" with the annual series, he says Black Ops 7 won't disappoint. \"I think this one just blows the others out of the water completely in the storytelling and where we go,\" he says. But Call of Duty's campaigns, no matter how well-crafted or explosive they are, aren't the main reason players turn up for the series each year. The game owes its long-running success to the popularity of its multiplayer modes, and the performance of Black Ops 7 will be judged on whether they succeed. When they're asked if Battlefield's impressive player numbers affect their approach to development, Natalie and Stephanie insist they're only focused on making Black Ops 7 \"the best game it can be\". As for what it offers that Battlefield can't, Stephanie says, without directly comparing the two, that Call of Duty has \"variety and volume\" of experiences to offer. \"But more broadly, she says, \"I see games as a way for people to connect, to have fun. \"They are certainly responsible for some awesome relationships in my life. \"I hope that people continue to forge those connections and bonds and relationships and there's just more of us playing games together in however many years from now.\" Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here .",

      "summary_tr_long": "Fire-blocking chemicals promise safer buildings Chris Baraniuk Technology Reporter Getty Images Fire resistant materials can buy time for fire fighters I'm peering into a large vat containing a perfectly clear liquid – a special kind of flame retardant for wood products. I have,\" says Stephen McCann, general & technical manager at Halt, a wood treatment company in Belfast. But this liquid, containing a substance called Burnblock, has been shown to prevent fire taking hold of wood in tests. In a video the firm has shared online , two small model houses are blasted with a blow torch. One, treated with a different product, is engulfed in flames to such an extent that it collapses. The Burnblock-treated model gets heavily charred in one corner but remains otherwise unharmed. Neither Mr McCann nor Hroar Bay-Smidt, chief executive of Burnblock itself, a Danish firm, will confirm the ingredients. However, documentation on Burnblock's website from the Danish Technological Institute states the flame retardant ingredient is \"a natural component in the body\" and that the mixture also contains citric acid and \"a natural component in some berries\". Flame retardants, chemicals added to products to try and slow down how they burn, have been around in various forms for centuries. But many of the flame retardants developed in the 20th Century are highly toxic . \"There hasn't been a lot of investment in replacements so now all of a sudden people are scrambling to find them,\" says Alex Morgan, a chemist and flame retardant expert at the University of Dayton Research Institute in the US. When you try to set fire to wood treated with Burnblock, the material forms a protective layer of char, explains Mr Bay-Smidt. \"That helps absorb the heat and slows the fire's spread.\" And, it prevents oxygen feeding the flames. Halt, which has been operating in Belfast for nearly four years, has supplied Burnblock-treated wood products to hundreds of locations around the UK and Ireland. From restaurants to hotels and even HS2. For the latter, Halt provided treated hoardings used to fence off construction areas in tunnels. \"It could be quite difficult to get out of the tunnel so they need as much time as possible to evacuate [in the event of a fire],\" says Mr McCann. I ask whether any of the buildings or facilities constructed with wood treated by Halt have ever been affected by a fire to date – \"No\" is the answer. Halt exposes wood to a vacuum, pressure and a flame retardant fluid In one of Halt's buildings they have a huge machine called an autoclave, consisting mainly of two large horizontal tubes. When the tube below it is loaded with pieces of wood, it first exposes them to a vacuum, to open up the wood's pores, says Mr McCann. Then, pressure appropriate to the species of wood in question is applied, along with the treatment fluid. \"What that pressure is doing is, it's forcing the fire retardant into the very core of the timber,\" says Mr McCann. After this, the wood goes into a large kiln where it is dried in a process that can last anywhere from 10 days to six weeks. It's carefully managed – drying that happens too quickly or too slowly can warp the wood. \"Timber is an amazing material,\" says Richard Hull, professor emeritus and fire retardants expert at the University of Lancashire. \"There was a lot of work done on clay nanocomposites in the early 2000s,\" he says. \"Now, 20-25 years later, essentially 99% of that has fizzled out.\" University of Dayton Research Institute There's a scramble to find new flame retardant chemicals says Alex Morgan While timber tends to burn at a fixed rate, making plastic flame resistant is another story because plastics tend to burn at an accelerating rate, he explains. Dr Morgan adds that he calls polyethylene, a type of plastic commonly used in construction, \"solid gasoline\" because of its similar chemical structure and capacity to burn rapidly. In Australia, First Graphene says it has found a way to slow the spread of fire in plastics by adding graphene – tiny flakes of carbon atoms arranged in honeycomb lattices. Michael Bell, managing director and chief executive, says the firm's solution, PureGRAPH, has already been added to products including protective footwear and conveyor belts used in the mining industry. First Graphene says it works by forming a protective gas barrier, preventing the release of volatile compounds prior to ignition, and also a char layer should ignition occur. But graphene is a notoriously enigmatic material and the company says there may be other mechanisms at work, which are not yet fully understood. A spokeswoman says, \"There's no data suggesting that graphene poses any health hazards. The industry continues to test and evaluate these aspects.\" In the UK, Vector Homes is preparing to sell a licence for PureGRAPH to makers of plastic pellets that could be used to make construction materials such as fascia boards. \"It hits the highest ratings in those tests,\" says Liam Britnell, co-founder and chief technology officer. That's why Eric Appel at Stanford University, and colleagues have been working on gel-like fire retardants that could be sprayed onto a home hours before a wildfire reaches it, to limit the damage. Lab work revealed that, upon exposure to a flame, one of the gels he was working on bubbled up to form a porous aerogel structure within it that is highly protective against fire. \"As soon as I saw that it did that, it was like, 'Oh my gosh – that would be perfect for this',\" recalls Prof Appel.",

      "summary_tr_long": "'This is the big one' - tech firms bet on electrifying rail Chris Baraniuk Technology Reporter AFP via Getty Images Diesel locomotives are being replaced with electric models Every day, thousands of passengers heading south west on trains leaving Aldershot station pass a cluster of solar panels nestled by the tracks. \"On a sunny afternoon, if you are catching a train through Aldershot, a little bit of the energy for that train will come from those solar panels,\" says Leo Murray, co-founder and chief executive of Riding Sunbeams, a start-up aiming to use renewable energy resources for rail electrification projects. Riding Sunbeams built the Aldershot array in 2019 . It's small in scale at just 40 kilowatts – equivalent to roughly 10 of the rooftop solar arrays you would find on a typical British home. Not only that, Mr Murray says it is currently the only solar array in the country that delivers power directly to rail to move trains. Around the country, and the world, many trains still run on diesel – a fossil fuel. To go electric, rail operators have traditionally had two options: electrified rail, or overhead lines that that trains connect to with arm-like pantographs on their roofs. But engineers are working on new ways of implementing such technologies and completely different alternatives are also emerging, which could speed up electrification projects. This is why he views solar panels as so useful in enabling railway electrification projects. Mr Murray says that, after the Aldershot project, he had hoped Riding Sunbeams would go on to build a full-scale commercial pilot. Now, however, Network Rail, which owns and maintains railway infrastructure in Great Britain, is seeking suppliers for rail-side renewables projects. \"This is the big one,\" says Mr Murray, explaining that his business is planning to bid for a contract. Riding Sunbeams Leo Murray would like to see more solar panels next to railway tracks New projects bring new complexities, however. At Aldershot, the track was already electrified – it was a case of plugging solar panels in to that existing system. But for trains that are switching off diesel and moving over to overhead lines, leveraging solar is harder. This is because solar panels produce direct current (DC) electricity whereas overhead lines use alternating current (AC). Efforts are underway in England to develop a new converter device that could solve this problem, though. Separately, Colton Junction between Leeds and York, the fastest railway junction in the UK – where trains speed through at up to 125mph – was electrified recently with the help of software developed at the University of Huddersfield. The software makes a 3D model of the overhead line system, allowing engineers to plan its construction in minute detail – lowering costs by removing the need for certain forms of traditional testing and evaluation. \"Everything was specified in the software in terms of measurements,\" says João Pombo, associate director of the university's Institute of Railway Research. \"All the trains are running at maximum speed at that junction since August.\" Nevomo Poland's Nevomo has developed an electromagnetic propulsion system But there are completely different ideas for electrification out there. It's retrofitted onto existing track by fitting a thick aluminium cable into an enclosure that runs between the rails. This generates a magnetic field strong enough to propel freight wagons fitted with magnets. \"We eliminate locomotives completely,\" says Ben Paczek, founder and chief executive. They can also operate in groups.\" A key benefit of the technology, says Mr Paczek, is that it allows operators to bring freight wagons to a stop very quickly – and, as a consequence, that means they could, in principle, safely put lots of independently moving wagons relatively close together on one stretch of rail, increasing the density of freight transportation in a particular area. Nevomo hopes to launch working implementations of its technology at a steel plant in Bremen, Germany, and at a port in India next year. These will be relatively small in scale, each covering track distances of less than 1km (0.6 miles). \"In a quite conservative environment like rail, we need to demonstrate it properly first.\" It would be possible to automate the motion of electromagnetically-propelled wagons, he adds – though initially they will be controlled remotely by human operators. University of Birmingham New railways tech needs to prove there's a business case says Stuart Hillmansen In the US, Parallel Systems is also working on electrifying individual freight wagons so that they can move independently around a rail network – but in a very different way, with batteries. The firm's wagons would have a range of 800km, says co-founder and chief executive Matt Soule. He describes it like moving packets around a distribution centre – \"atomised freight\", and quite unlike traditional locomotive-pulled freight trains that can be more than 2km long . He adds that he does not aim to replace freight locomotives, but rather to offer a rail-based delivery service that could compete with trucking. \"If we simply grab 10% of the trucking market, we've doubled the rail industry,\" he says. Stuart Hillmansen at the University of Birmingham, who has worked with Riding Sunbeams in the past, says organising the movement of individual freight trains on an existing rail network could be \"quite challenging – certainly on [British] railways\". But he says that new technologies are helping to facilitate electrification – and that electrified trains in general are now the \"go-to\" option for new railways. \"All of these technologies are physically feasible and can work, the thing is managing the business case,\" he says.",

It projects over 335,000 people will be flying in the UK on Wednesday, which is up 5% from Christmas Eve in 2024, though minimal disruption is expected. Britain's roads are also expected to see one of the busiest Christmas Eves since records began said the RAC, though another motoring lobby says traffic peaks for the season have passed. The RAC said the worst time to travel on Wednesday is from 1pm to 7pm as millions hit the road to get home before Christmas Day on Thursday, with delays expected on major routes. Manchester airport said on Christmas Eve it expects around 75,000 passengers passing through, with 208 flights leaving the UK, but that number will halve on Christmas Day. Its most popular destinations on Christmas Eve are Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin. Heathrow meanwhile says it is expecting its busiest December period ever, including 152,000 passengers using it on Christmas Day. EasyJet said 558 flights will depart on Christmas Day, part of \"its busiest festive season ever\". Stansted Airport said Christmas Day for it, meanwhile, will be relatively quiet. The busiest single day of the festive period for air travel was Friday 19 December. Getty Images The RAC meanwhile said particular tight spots on the roads will be the clockwise northern and western sections of the M25 from mid-morning, and the M5 north from Gloucestershire towards the West Midlands later in the afternoon. While millions will travel by rail, earlier last-train times mean many may take to the road, making them even more congested. Several rail routes will be restricted or closed over the Christmas period for maintenance. National Rail trains do not run on Christmas Day and only a small number will run on Boxing Day. National Express coaches says it is running on Christmas day to 96 destinations. The RAC's mobile servicing and repair's team leader Nick Mullender said 2025 was \"looking to be the busiest getaway period since our records began\" in 2013. He said this year's Christmas Eve would be the busiest, with workers saving on annual leave days and heading off on getaways at the last minute. Meanwhile the AA, which provides traffic updates across the UK, said 19 December was the busiest part of the season. For Christmas Eve, it warned the M27 will close in both directions between Junction 9 (Whiteley/Park Gate) and Junction 11 (Fareham East/Gosport) from 8pm until 4am on 4 January for major works at Junction 10. This closure affects road journeys between Southampton and Portsmouth. Drivers are advised to check tyres, expect delays and ensure oil and coolant levels are correct. It expected a rise in breakdowns as the weather becomes colder and 4.2 million journeys will be taken on roads. You can see how weather will affect your Christmas travel plans on the road. You can see here how other transport, such as ferries, are affected.",

      "summary_tr_long": "BP sells stake in motor oil arm Castrol for $6bn Archie Mitchell Business reporter Getty Images BP has struck a $6bn (£4.4bn) deal to sell a majority stake in its motor oil division Castrol to a US investment firm. The oil giant sold a 65% stake in Castrol, which makes lubricants for cars, motorcycles and industrial vehicles, to New York-based Stonepeak. The deal valued Castrol at $10.1bn (£7.5bn), with BP receiving $6bn in cash, which it will use to pay down debts and allow it to focus on its core business. BP will hold onto a 35% stake in Castrol, which it first took control of in 2000. The London-based oil major said the sale is a \"milestone\" in its plans to overhaul its business and strip out costs. BP in February announced plans to sell off $20bn (£15bn) worth of assets in a bid to focus on its core crude oil and gas business and strengthen its balance sheet. Following today's deal and previous announcements, the company says its over half way to meeting that target. It is also shifting its strategy away from investment in green energy and renewing its focus on oil and gas following pressure from some investors who were frustrated that its profits and share price had lagged behind rivals. Rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's call to \"drill baby drill\" has encouraged firms to invest in fossil fuels. The Castrol sale comes a week after BP unveiled its first female chief executive , Meg O'Neill, who will take the helm in April 2026. Her surprise appointment came only three months after BP appointed a new chairman, Albert Manifold. And she was handed the top job less than two years after Murray Auchincloss took over from Bernard Looney as chief executive. Wednesday's deal is the latest in a series of sales by the firm, which included offloading its US onshore wind energy business and its Dutch mobility and convenience arm. Interim chief executive Carol Howle said the sale is a \"very good outcome for all stakeholders\". \"We are reducing complexity, focusing the downstream on our leading integrated businesses, and accelerating delivery of our plan,\" she added. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the deal was \"an early Christmas present\" for BP shareholders. \"The significant proceeds from the transaction will allow BP to make a decent dent in its onerous borrowings pile. It also means it is well on the way to achieving its goal of $20 billion worth of divestments by 2027,\" he said. Shares in BP opened higher on Wednesday morning on the news, before giving up most of their gains.",

      "summary_tr_long": "US economy grows at fastest pace in two years Natalie Sherman Business reporter Bloomberg via Getty Images The US economy picked up speed over the three months to September, as consumer spending jumped and exports increased. The world's largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.3%, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter. That was better than expected, and marked the strongest growth in two years. The report, which had been delayed by the US government shutdown, sheds light on an economy that has been buffeted by dramatic changes to trade and immigration policies, as well as persistent inflation and cuts to government spending. But while that has led to sharp swings in some areas, such as imports and exports, the underlying economy has maintained solid momentum, outperforming many forecasts. \"This is an economy that has defied doom and gloom expectations basically since the beginning of 2022\", said Aditya Bhave, senior economist at Bank of America. Speaking to the BBC's Business Today programme, Mr Bhave described the economy as \"very very resilient\". \"I don't see why that wouldn't continue going forward,\" he added. The overall growth figure for the third quarter of the year was much stronger than expected, with most analysts expecting an annual pace of about 3.2%. It was lifted by consumer spending that rose at an annual rate of 3.5%, compared with 2.5% in the previous quarter, despite a slowing job market, as households spent more on health care services. Imports - which count against growth - continued to decline, reflecting the wave of taxes on shipments entering the US that President Donald Trump announced this spring. Meanwhile exports, which had dropped sharply, bounced back, surging by 7.4%. Government spending also rebounded, driven by defence outlays. Those gains helped to overcome a slowdown in business investment, including in intellectual property, and a housing market struggling under the weight of still-high interest rates, which have heightened affordability issues and supply constraints. Michael Pearce, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said the economy was well positioned as it headed into 2026, when it will start to feel the boost from tax cuts and the US central bank's recent moves to drop interest rates. \"Underlying measures are consistent with a solid expansion,\" he said. In a post on social media, Trump celebrated the figures, saying his tariffs were responsible. He has been on the defensive amid souring consumer confidence and polls indicating dissatisfaction with his handling of the economy. However, some analysts warned that rising prices faced by some households could make it difficult to sustain the unusually strong pace of growth seen in the most recent quarter. Over the three months to September, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, ticked up 2.8%, compared with 2.1% in the previous quarter, according to the report. Analysts have warned that those price increases are weighing on lower and middle income households, even as higher income households continue to spend freely. Oliver Allen, senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that some more recent surveys and credit card data suggest that households are reining in their spending. \"The weak labour market, stagnant real incomes, and exhaustion of pandemic-era excess savings all seem finally to be catching up with households,\" he said.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Major fires still a risk under 'spineless' new safety law, construction boss warns Getty Images Blocks of flats in Stratford’s East Village were found to fire safety issues, some of which have now been resolved Government plans to turn post-Grenfell fire safety guidance into law have been strongly criticised by a leading voice in the construction industry. David Jones, president of the Institute of Construction Management, says the guidance for multi-storey residential buildings is \"loose\", \"spineless\" and \"open to interpretation\". He argues it permits too many \"tolerable\" risks - for example, allowing flammable materials in window systems and between floors to remain even if they could let fire spread. \"It's allowing developers to game the system,\" the veteran of more than 50 years says, adding that making it law would be an \"absolute abomination\". Mr Jones is the first senior building industry leader to publicly criticise the plans, which are currently out for consultation. The government says the guidelines are a proportionate approach to dealing with the flammable cladding crisis. Ministers insist making them law will bring clarity and certainty to the process of deciding which fire safety defects need addressing. Mr Jones argues the guidance, which the government wants to enshrine into law, permits too many \"tolerable\" fire risks Cladding campaigners say the word \"tolerable\" appears dozens of times in the guidelines, which are known in the industry as PAS 9980. Combustible materials are allowed to remain in place if risks are assessed to be \"tolerable\" - meaning in a standard fire test a blaze does not spread beyond one floor within 15 minutes or two floors within 30 minutes. Mr Jones argues that in the guidance, engineers are not explicitly required to present fire test safety data for these materials, making assessments subjective and open to interpretation. He believes the lack of a ban on materials with \"limited combustibility\" is \"another gaming of the system. It's a fuel, it just burns a little bit slower.\" Part of the government's motivation for tolerating certain risks is to avoid delays caused by disagreements about how much work is needed to make buildings constructed with cladding safe. Progress has been slow in the eight years since the Grenfell tragedy. Ministry of Housing statistics for December show around 475 of the more than 5,500 blocks so far identified as unsafe have been completely fixed and certified as safe in the last 12 months. Cladding has been replaced in 35% of those dangerous blocks since Grenfell - including nearly all of the tallest buildings with the same type of cladding as Grenfell Tower. Residents' representatives fear that any flammable materials left in place can lead to a lower fire safety rating - even after repairs. In turn, this could result in permanently higher building insurance premiums. In a statement, the government said it was up to the insurance industry to bring premiums down once buildings are certified as safe. The insurance industry says if flammable materials remain, it will price the risk accordingly. View Pictures via Getty Images Seven years have passed after the problems at East Village, the Olympic Park development, were discovered Mr Jones also criticises the fact the guidelines only deal with the exterior facades of buildings - covering cladding and insulation issues. Fire safety inspections since Grenfell have revealed many tower blocks also have significant internal fire safety defects. The government has robustly rejected Mr Jones's criticisms. It adds the new law will prevent what it describes as unnecessary work and disturbance for residents. A consultation on the guidance becoming law ends on 31 December, with legislation planned in 2026.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Government waters down inheritance tax plan for farms Kate Whannel, political reporter, Georgia Roberts, Derby political reporter and Joe Pike, politics investigations correspondent PA Media Farmers protested against the changes again at last month's Budget Government proposals to tax inherited farmland have been watered down, with the planned threshold increasing from £1m to £2.5m. The climbdown follows months of protests by farmers and concern from some Labour backbenchers. At last year's Budget, ministers said they would start imposing a 20% tax on inherited agricultural assets worth more than £1m from April 2026, ending the 100% tax relief that had been in place since the 1980s. In an announcement put out after MPs had left Parliament for the Christmas recess, Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds said: \"We have listened closely to farmers across the country and we are making changes today to protect more ordinary family farms.\" \"It's only right that larger estates contribute more, while we back the farms and trading businesses that are the backbone of Britain's rural communities, \" she said. Head of the National Farmers' Union Tom Bradshaw welcomed the change, telling BBC Radio 5 Live it \"takes out many family farms from the eye of a pernicious storm\". Gavin Lane, president of the Country Land and Business Association, said: \"The government deserves credit for recognising the flaws in the original policy and changing course. \"However, this announcement only limits the damage - it doesn't eradicate it entirely. \"Many family businesses will own enough expensive machinery and land to be valued above the threshold, yet still operate on such narrow profit margins that this tax burden remains unaffordable.\" Ben Ardern, a farmer from Derbyshire, told the BBC said it was \"a step in the right direction\". He said the government should \"drop it [the tax] for family farms... and just tax the people who have got the money to tax. \"The big corporations who have just buried money into land - they're not farmers, they have just done it to avoid tax. Farmers haven't bought land to avoid tax, we've bought land to farm it and grow food.\" Ben Ardern, a third generation beef and dairy farmer from Buxton, has organised protests against the tax In the 14 months since the initial proposal was announced, there have been regular protests by farmers outside Parliament. Some Labour MPs in rural areas have also expressed concern. At a recent parliamentary vote on the plan, a dozen backbenchers abstained and one, Markus Campbell-Savours, voted against. Campbell-Savours was subsequently suspended for voting against the government, meaning he now sits as an independent MP. John Whitby, a Labour MP from the Rural Research Group of backbenchers, said the government's climbdown on inheritance tax was \"fantastic news\". But one Labour source described the timing of the change as \"bizarre\". They added that many MPs would be annoyed as \"they were made to vote for it so recently\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said in a post on social media: \"This fight isn't finished. \"Other family businesses are still affected by Labour's tax raid, and we will keep pushing until the tax is lifted from them too.\" Liberal Democrat spokesperson Tim Farron MP said: \"It is utterly inexcusable that family farmers have been put through over a year of uncertainty and anguish since the government first announced these changes. \"We demand that the government scraps this unfair tax in full and if they refuse to, Liberal Democrats will submit amendments in the new year to bring it down.\" Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice said: \"This cynical climbdown - whilst better than nothing - does little to address the year of anxiety that farmers have faced in planning to protect their livelihoods... with British agriculture hanging by a thread, the government must go further and abolish this callous farms tax.\" In her first Budget in 2024, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced she would be reversing the 100% inheritance tax relief on agricultural assets that had been in place since the 1980s. The move would have seen inherited agricultural assets worth over £1m taxed at 20%, half the standard inheritance tax rate, raising an estimated £520m annually by 2029. The government had argued that the change would protect smaller farms while stopping wealthy investors from buying farmland as a tax loophole. However, it has now stepped back from the original proposal raising the threshold level to £2.5m. Coupled with an exemption which allows farmers to pass on assets to their spouses tax-free, this new government concession means a couple could pass on up to £5m in qualifying assets, without paying tax. Above the threshold, a 50% relief will be applied to the remaining assets. According to the government, the number of estates in the UK expected to pay more inheritance tax in 2026/27 will be reduced from around 2,000 under the original plans to 1,100 under the new proposal. A Treasury source said changing the thresholds would cost the government £130m, but that there were \"no plans\" for the policy to be scrapped entirely. \"The principle of reforming the tax system remains,\" the source said. \"It's right that the wealthiest estates pay their fair share, but smaller farms will get help.\" The climbdown is the latest in a series of U-turns the government has made since being elected in July 2024. Earlier this year the government eased cuts to winter fuel payments and backtracked on plans to make £5bn of cuts to the welfare bill.",

Her total earnings jumped by more than two thirds from almost £158m a year earlier , despite profits at the gambling firm tumbling. Ms Coates was awarded £104m in salary in the year to March 2025, Companies House filings show. In addition, as a majority shareholder in Bet365, she was entitled to at least half of the £354m dividend payment declared by the firm for the year. The £280m package means she has earned more than £2bn from Bet365 over the past decade. Campaign group the High Pay Centre condemned Ms Coates's pay as too high. Director Andrew Speke said: \"Denise Coates is well-liked in Stoke for being self-made and giving back to her community. \"But the eye-watering sums she earns go far beyond what anyone needs for a life of luxury - and her fortune comes from an industry that has caused real harm to too many people.\" Bet365 has been approached for comment. Her latest pay deal came as Bet365's pre-tax profit fell to £339m for the year, from £596m previously. Overall revenue rose by 9%, from £3.7bn a year earlier to £4bn. Ms Coates founded Bet365 in a portable building in a Stoke-on-Trent car park more than 20 years ago. It is now the biggest private sector employer in the city and offers sports betting, poker, casino games and bingo online to millions of customers worldwide. She is one of Britain's richest women and among the world's highest-paid executives. After training as an accountant, Ms Coates helped build Bet365 into one of the biggest online gambling companies from her father's bookmaking business. Her brother, John Coates, is a co-chief executive of the company. As well as being one of the UK's best-paid bosses, Ms Coates is reportedly among the country's biggest taxpayers . Her £104m salary would see her pay tens of millions in income tax and national insurance. Bet365 also said the company paid £482m of tax in the year to March, up from £364m a year earlier, including tax on dividend payments. During the year, Bet365 donated £130m to the Denise Coates Foundation, which donates to charities covering education, arts and culture and health.",

The couple are among more than 300 people who have contacted the BBC in recent weeks to tell us about insulation that has gone wrong in their homes. ''You wouldn't put your family through this.

      "summary_tr_long": "Our son can't come home for Christmas after insulation mould took over Zoe Conway News Correspondent The Wadleys tell the BBC of the ongoing impact of problems with the insulation Tony and Becs Wadley say they can't spend Christmas at home after insulation installed under a government scheme has caused black mould in several rooms, and their asthmatic son can't be inside the property. Elliott can't come into our house, it's as if he's been ostracised from his own home.'' The couple are among more than 300 people who have contacted the BBC in recent weeks to tell us about insulation that has gone wrong in their homes. The Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said it was taking action to ensure consumers are no longer let down by poor installations. It spread under internal wall insulation which was installed in 2024. Mr and Mrs Wadley got a government grant to have energy efficiency measures fitted in their Gower Peninsula house because they hoped a warmer home would help Elliott's asthma. But months after the work was completed, the Wadleys discovered black mould was growing behind the insulation boards. Elliott, 19, hasn't entered the house since April, instead staying with his grandmother during university breaks. Billions of pounds of public money has been spent on insulating homes over the last 15 years. The Wadleys' home was insulated under a government scheme known as ECO4. In October, the National Audit Office (NAO) spending watchdog found that 98% of homes fitted with external wall insulation under ECO4 and the Great British Insulation Scheme since 2022 had major issues that needed to be repaired. It added that 29% of homes that had internal wall insulation fitted under the schemes had major issues. DESNZ said it had \"inherited a flawed system of oversight and regulation\". A spokesman for the department said it was \"committed to introducing comprehensive reforms through the Warm Homes Plan to ensure that consumers get the quality installations they deserve and failures like these are not repeated\". The spokesman added: \"People should not be expected to navigate a complex web of organisations when they want to improve their homes – and with this government, they won't.\" Becs Wadley Becs and Tony Wadley with their three sons Felix, Freddie and Elliott. The installer, Stellar Energy, says it has ''no record of any immediate safety hazards being flagged.'' It says the descriptions of the exposed wires and sockets was \"highly inconsistent\" with their standard operating procedures, which required all such work to be made safe. Building surveyor, David Walter, says the insulation wasn't fitted correctly and says the installer ''didn't understand what they were doing and what they were doing to the building which is why we've got these problems.'' Stellar Energy told the BBC the design was ''technically correct for a stone house and was installed...in strict accordance with the mandatory technical specifications of ECO4.'' Mr Wadley says he wouldn't have signed up for the grant if he'd known what would happen. Somebody needs to take responsibility.'' Stellar Energy says it ''sincerely regrets any distress this situation has caused the family'' and says its priority is ''providing a final resolution to ensure the home meets the high standards'' it strives for. Scott Proudman had external wall insulation fitted to his family's home in 2021 under a government scheme. He is facing a £20,000 bill to get it replaced. Scott Proudman contacted the BBC about the botched external wall insulation fitted to his Bristol home in 2021. His family had been eligible for a government grant because of his eight-year-old daughter's disabilities. Born 24 weeks premature, she has cerebral palsy, a partial visual impairment and was recently diagnosed with autism. When the work was done, insulation boards were fixed to the outside of the house and render was applied to make it waterproof. As a result, the insulation underneath it is no longer waterproof and damp and mould could grow inside the house. Building surveyor Mr Walter, says poor design and poor workmanship has caused the render to disintegrate. He says rainwater will very likely get under the cracked render and behind the insulation and will likely cause dampness inside. Mr Walter says all of the render and insulation will have to come off and will cost tens of thousands of pounds to put right. Right now the family is stuck with the repair bill because the installer, SPMS Wales, is being liquidated and Mr Proudman says they weren't given the required guarantee for the work. Trustmark, the organisation responsible for overseeing quality, told Mr Proudman it couldn't help because the company is no longer accredited. Mr Proudman says he chose the company ''because it was on a government website and was Trustmark registered. I can't believe how few rights consumers have.'' Brett Langdon, a director at SPMS Wales says he is ''very sorry the Proudmans have ended up in this situation'' and says all works ''were done to the manufactures specification.'' He says he gave a guarantee to the Proudmans but has told the BBC he can't remember who the guarantee is with. In a statement TrustMark said it was ''very sorry to hear about what's happened to Mr and Mrs Proudman and Mr and Mrs Wadley and the conditions both families' homes have been left in. It is totally unacceptable and we are in discussions with the relevant Scheme Providers and guarantee providers to help resolve these situations.'' And it said it underlined ''the need for reform to the current system''.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Who are the frontrunners for the top Fed job? Danielle Kaye Business reporter Reuters The high-stakes search for a new leader of the US central bank is drawing to a close. US President Donald Trump is expected to name someone in the coming weeks to replace Jerome Powell, whose term as Federal Reserve chairman will end in May. That person will step into the role at a tricky moment. The bank is contending with both political pressure and internal disagreement about how it should set interest rates in the months ahead. Credibility concerns could make the job even harder. Trump has made clear he wants lower borrowing costs and put unusual pressure on the Fed, raising questions about whether whoever wins the post will act independently. Trump's nominee would then go to the Senate for confirmation. Here's what to know about the frontrunners. Kevin Hassett, a Trump loyalist Reuters Kevin Hassett, a long-time conservative economist and key Trump economic adviser, is seen as a top contender to succeed Powell. A Trump loyalist, Hassett, 63, served as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during Trump's first term and now leads the National Economic Council. His odds of clinching the role have dropped since early December, but Wall Street traders still deem him the most likely choice. Hassett has been a stalwart defender of Trump's economic policies, downplaying data showing signs of weakness in the US economy and repeating allegations of bias at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. His allegiance to the president has drawn questions from analysts about whether he would act independently at the Fed and how much sway he would have with other members of the board. In a research note, Deutsche Bank economists wrote that Hassett might struggle, at least initially, to convince other policymakers to put aside concerns about inflation and cut rates meaningfully. \"Other officials might be sceptical of forward-looking arguments that rely heavily on the administration's policies bringing inflation closer to target,\" they wrote. Even some within the Trump administration have reportedly questioned whether Hassett has the skills needed to effectively take the helm of the central bank. Hassett addressed those questions in a CNBC interview this month, saying that the Fed's independence was \"really, really important\", while reiterating that interest rates still had room to fall. \"The way you've got to drive interest-rate movements is with consensus based on the facts and the data,\" he said. Kevin Warsh, a Fed critic Bloomberg via Getty Images Kevin Warsh, who served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, has re-emerged in recent weeks as another potential pick. The 55 year-old economist, a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution who serves on the board of UPS, had also been considered for Fed chair during Trump's first term. He briefly overtook Hassett in prediction markets this month before falling back to second place. \"I think the two Kevins are great,\" Trump told the Wall Street Journal this month. Warsh has been an outspoken Fed critic, lambasting everything from the central bank's heavy reliance on data to its use of assets on its balance sheet. He has escalated his rhetoric since emerging as a contender for the top Fed job this year, calling for \"regime change\". Warsh had a relatively \"hawkish\" reputation as Fed governor, meaning that he tended to favour higher interest rates and focused on concerns about inflation. But he is now seen as a voice that would support lower rates in the near term. He has argued that the Fed should shrink its balance sheet in order to bring down short-term interest rates, though some have questioned that logic. \"He thinks you have to lower interest rates,\" Trump told the Journal. \"And so does everybody else that I've talked to.\" Warsh also has close family connections to Trump's orbit. His father-in-law, billionaire businessman Ronald Lauder, is a longtime Trump donor and ally. Christopher Waller, an Fed insider Bloomberg via Getty Images Christopher Waller, a current Fed governor, recently met with Trump for an interview, boosting his chances for the job in prediction markets. He was nominated to the Fed's board by Trump in 2020 and has recently stressed that the Fed has room to lower interest rates even further. Waller, 66, lacks the personal ties that could help propel Hassett and Warsh to the top of Trump's list. Wall Street, however, has looked favourably upon his relative distance from the White House. Trump, when asked about Waller following their meeting, called him \"great\", adding that \"he's a man who's been there a long time\". While the two Kevins remain the favourites, Waller is emerging as \"the more sensible choice\", said Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital. He noted that choosing Waller could open up two spots on the Fed board for Trump to fill next year, since Fed governor Stephen Miran's term is set to end. It remains to be seen who will satisfy the president. Other names floated include BlackRock executive Rick Reider and even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. In the end, no matter who emerges the winner from this contest, it may be Wall Street that serves as final judge of their success.",

Some sub-postmasters went to prison, while many more were financially ruined and lost their livelihoods.",
      "summary_tr_long": "Post Office had deal with Fujitsu to fix Horizon errors 19 years ago Andy Verity, Financial investigations correspondent and Emma Simpson, Business correspondent Getty Images The Post Office and Fujitsu agreed a deal 19 years ago to fix transaction errors in sub-postmasters' accounts caused by bugs in the Horizon IT system, a document has revealed. An agreement was in place in 2006 for errors caused by bugs in the software to be corrected, or for Fujitsu to pay the Post Office up to £150 per transaction if it failed to do so. The revelation directly contradicts the Post Office's claims during criminal prosecutions - which led to hundreds of wrongful convictions and civil cases that destroyed livelihoods - that no bugs existed capable of causing accounting shortfalls. It also shows the Post Office knew almost two decades ago that Horizon could not always be relied upon to record transactions accurately. Between 1999 and 2015, more than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted after the faulty Horizon IT system made it look like money was missing from branch accounts. It has been described as the biggest miscarriage of justice in British legal history and has led to a long-running public inquiry into the scandal. Countless evidence and testimonies have been heard, examined and reported during the inquiry, but a document which emerged in material published this month contained new, previously unknown, information. The document shows that unbeknown to sub-postmasters, the two parties had a financial framework in place to manage discrepancies and for Fujitsu to fix problems or pay for them. The Post Office denied throughout the criminal trials of sub-postmasters that errors or bugs could cause transaction shortfalls in branch accounts. The document indicates the formal commercial arrangement was drawn up to deal with potential mismatches or \"discrepancies\" and where Fujitsu's system was responsible, it was expected to correct false transactions or pay \"liquidation damages\". The disclosure also undermines the Post Office's claim to the media and before Parliament in 2015 that it was not possible for Fujitsu to alter sub-postmasters's transactions without their knowledge. \"The Post Office conducted both the criminal trials of postmasters and the group litigation of 2019 on the basis that it knew of no substantial problems with the Horizon system,\" said Paul Marshall, senior barrister for sub-postmasters. \"Yet this shows that in 2006 there was a very big, recognised problem with Horizon maintaining data integrity between Post Office branch offices and Fujitsu,\" he added. \"The Post Office, for 20 years, was saying the only explanation for shortfalls in branch accounts was postmaster incompetence or dishonesty. \"But the maintenance of data integrity was fundamental to the Post Office-Fujitsu contract - Fujitsu were unable to provide or assure this.\" The document implicitly acknowledges that data held on Horizon's servers at Fujitsu's headquarters could fail to match the transactions sub-postmasters had carried out at their branches. It also adds to evidence that the Post Office was aware that the branch accounts of sub-postmasters could be remotely accessed. In the landmark Alan Bates vs Post Office case, for example, the organisation insisted that the software could not be accessed remotely by any other party. Under the arrangements set out in the document, Fujitsu agreed to carry out a \"reconciliation service\" with the Post Office's approval, where it was required to correct errors caused by bugs or defects or pay up to £150 per transaction in penalties known as \"liquidated damages\". The document is dated four months before the Post Office started legal action against sub-postmaster Lee Castleton OBE pursuing him to recover £25,000 of cash it alleged was missing from his branch in East Yorkshire. He represented himself in court, arguing that problems with Horizon were to blame, but lost and was landed with £321,000 in legal costs and ended up bankrupt as a result. All the pain and punishment the victims have taken all these years and it was buried,\" he told the BBC. \"It makes me feel physically ill to think they were doing that and not telling anyone...it's time they were held accountable for all those actions.\" The document, first discovered by Post Office scandal campaigner Stuart Goodwillie, supports what whistleblower Richard Roll told BBC Panorama in 2015. The former Fujitsu worker said the team working on Horizon would sometimes correct thousands of transactions per night because the firm could be forced to pay cash to the Post Office if it failed to do so. The agreement also notes that Fujitsu can and will amend transactional data, with the need for the Post Office to approve the entries. The document is listed in an annexe in two corporate witness statements provided by Fujitsu's current European chief executive, Paul Patterson, in 2024 but has only recently been published. Mr Patterson will face questions by MPs on the Business and Trade Committee on 6 January about the Horizon scandal. The material document has shocked experts on the scandal such as Second Sight forensic accountant Ron Warmington, who described the document's implications as \"dynamite\". A Fujitsu spokesperson said: \"These matters are the subject of forensic investigation by the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry and it's not appropriate for us to comment while that process is ongoing.\" A Post Office spokesperson said: \"We apologise unequivocally for the hurt and suffering which Post Office caused to so many people during the Horizon IT Scandal. \"Today, our organisation is focused on working transparently with the ongoing public inquiry, paying full and fair financial redress to those impacted, and establishing a meaningful restorative justice programme, all of which are important elements of the ongoing transformation of Post Office.\"",

      "summary_tr_long": "The US is immediately pausing leases for offshore wind energy projects currently being built near the Atlantic coastline, citing security concerns. In a statement, the Department of the Interior said it was pausing five large-sale projects to look into how windmills could interfere with radar and create other risks to east coast cities. President Donald Trump has long opposed wind energy, saying it is unreliable and drives up costs, and attempted to stop all projects when he returned to office. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has said wind farms have no future in the US energy grid. Renewable energy companies, as well as state leaders, have expressed alarm over the administration's stance. In its statement, the Department of the Interior said the pause \"addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centres\". The five wind farms now on pause are being constructed off the coast of New York, Virginia, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. Specifically, the announcement noted that officials are concerned about radar interference \"clutter\" that can obscure real moving targets or, conversely, create false ones. It added that a radar's threshold for false-alarm detection could be increased to reduce some clutter, but only at the risk of missing actual targets. The wind projects could make it difficult to \"determine what's friend and foe in our airspace\", Burgum said in an interview with Fox Business on Monday, where he cited drone strikes between Russia and Ukraine and between Iran and Israel as examples. Dominion Energy, the company behind the Virginia wind farm, said its project is far offshore and \"does not raise visual impact concerns.\" \"The project's two pilot turbines have been operating for five years without causing any impacts to national security,\" it said in a statement. Dominion saw its share price drop more than 3% after the announcement. Orsted, the Danish wind energy giant, recorded a 12% drop in its share price, while turbine maker Vestas' stock fell by 2.6%. Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, a Democrat, described the pause as an \"erratic\" move that \"will drive up the price of electricity in Connecticut and throughout the region\". \"This project is nearing completion and providing good-paying clean energy jobs,\" he added. \"Businesses and residents deserve economic predictability, yet with the administration's constant starts and stops they're left with the opposite.\" Earlier in December, a federal judge struck down an attempt by President Trump to ban new wind power projects in the US, calling it \"arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law\". On the first day of his administration in January, Trump issued a memorandum halting permits and new leases until a federal review could be undertaken. Five months later, 17 US states led by New York sued the administration, calling the ban an \"existential\" threat to the US wind industry. Demand in the US for energy is expected to significantly expand in the years ahead, driven by the needs of artificial intelligence firms. Last week, Trump Media, the parent company of Truth Social that is majority-owned by the president, said it was getting into the energy business, announcing a merger with a fusion firm TAE Technologies.",

As reported by the Telegraph, the letter is understood to say that \"council staff undertaking part-time work for full-time pay without compelling justification would be considered an indicator, among a wide range of factors, of potential failure\". He added that he hoped he had made the government's policy \"unambiguously clear to all councils\". A Labour source said \"Voters deserve high standards and hard work from local councils, and seeing council staff working a four-day week just won't cut it.\" \"They should get on with the job and make sure residents get the best service possible five days a week,\" the source added. In the letter to the councils, which was reported by The Telegraph , Reed says that local authorities should not be offering \"full-time pay for part-time work\". Reed previously expressed his \"deep disappointment\" in the first UK council to adopt a four-day working week. South Cambridgeshire District Council, which is led by the Liberal Democrats, became the first to make a permanent move to a four-day week in July after it began trialling a shorter working week in 2023. Reed said there had been a decline in performance in the council's housing service and he asked how the local authority would \"mitigate\" this. The government can intervene in any council if it is deemed to be failing. Last year Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also rejected civil servants' demands for a four-day working week. Critics of a four-day week say it would reduce productivity and slow economic growth but others disagree. A trial in the Scottish public sector this year found an increase in productivity and improvements in staff well-being.

Nevertheless, Constantine remains bullish about the future of bricks-and-mortar shopping.",
      "summary_tr_long": "Lush co-founder takes pride in being a 'woke nerd' Pritti Mistry Business reporter Lush Most companies and bosses would squirm at the idea of being called \"woke\" and may even regard it as an insult. Lush's outspoken co-founder and chief executive wears it like a badge of honour and is not ashamed of turning it into a business philosophy. The firm is renowned for putting activism at the heart of its bright bath bombs business, tackling a range of issues from trans rights to police accountability. The 73-year-old is still steering the empire with the same principles that have defined its three decades on the High Street, which has seen it expand from a small Dorset store into a global brand with 869 outlets and an annual turnover of £690m. Lush has taken some of the boldest stances in British retail including shutting down some of its social media accounts over concerns about the impact on young people, and more recently closing stores for a day to protest against starvation in Gaza . A self-confessed \"over-achiever and a nerd\" who loves learning, he is up before the crack of dawn for his main passion - writing about birdsong - in between his meditation and Alexander technique, a therapy for good posture and movement. But his message is crystal clear to those who openly resent his values: \"You shouldn't come in my shop.\" It's a strong statement in an era when many businesses avoid political or cultural debates for fear of alienating customers and risking profits. Ben & Jerry's has long worn its social activism on its sleeve, which has caused tension with its parent company. Where Lush has remained an independent firm, Constantine believes selling out means sacrificing the business's values. \"If you've sold your business to someone else, I think you're asking a lot for them to do everything you want. They should never have sold.\" Ben & Jerry's co-founder Ben Cohen maintains they were opposed to selling but as a publicly-traded company, says US regulations forced their hand and the brand's social mission was written into the contract with the parent company. \"I have a huge appreciation for Lush, their values, and how they use their most powerful tool - their voice - to advocate for those values,\" Cohen told the BBC, following Constantine's Big Boss interview, adding, \"I'm not 'asking' for anything.\" Speaking to the BBC's Big Boss Interview podcast in the busy run-up to Christmas, Lush's Constantine says preparing for the festive period is \"very like war\". And then it's just a question of when will the onslaught occur?\" He suggests that men may be more likely to be out buying last-minute presents, saying with a laugh the company sees a lot of men \"who come in on Christmas Eve and tell us they're regulars\". But the key to attracting shoppers in the first place is by making retail \"fun\", says Constantine. Lush has turned shopping into more of an experience with offerings such as spa treatments and parties for customers. And it's experiences such as these that could help reverse the High Street's declining prospects, he believes. While some business leaders have suggested that a rise in employers' National Insurance contributions and in the minimum wage could result in hiring freezes, Constantine views it differently. \"It's good news for everyone and it's good for the economy because you've got more money coming into the economy at the biggest point. \"I'm delighted to pay the extra money to get the staff up to a proper level, and I think we should celebrate that.\" However Lush's pay record is not without blemish. In 2020, it admitted to underpaying its Australian workers more than $4m over nearly a decade. A company spokesperson told the BBC after the Big Boss interview: \"We made mistakes, we found those mistakes and have paid the money we owed, and we are ensuring those errors cannot happen again.\" In the same year Lush faced claims of poor working conditions at its Australian factory. The spokesperson added: \"Since these concerns were raised we swiftly developed an action plan to address the areas of concern.\" Lush is privately owned by all six co-founders – Constantine and his wife Mo, Rowena Bird, Helen Ambrosen, Liz Bennett and Paul Greeves – all of whom started the business in 1995 and have remained active since. Two of Constantine's three children also work for the company, which is particularly pleasing for a man who believes family is at the heart of a successful business and is key to longevity. \"Family businesses give better returns on investment at every level,\" he says, claiming they last longer because they ride out the good times and the bad. It's a lesson he learned from the late Dame Anita Roddick, founder of The Body Shop where it all began for Constantine in 1977 – manufacturing and supplying products to Roddick's stores. However, he says the government does not understand \"the strength of family businesses\" after it announced that from April 2026 family business assets of more than £1m will face inheritance tax when passed on to relatives. He believes this tax will force many owners to sell up, which is the \"real worry on succession\". A spokesperson for the Treasury said the government was \"pro-business\", pointing out that it had capped corporation tax at 25% and was reforming business rates. \"Right now, 53% of Business Property Relief – worth £533m – goes to just 158 estates. But he thinks modern retailing would benefit from a return to the old-fashioned values that once defined British retail, in particular innovation and kindness.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Drivers could be paying more than they should for petrol and diesel after the UK's competition watchdog said fuel profit margins remain at \"persistently high levels\" despite prices at the pump having fallen. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also challenged retailers' claims that this was a result of higher operating costs, and said competition in the sector was \"weak\". However, the Petrol Retailers Association said falling fuel prices were an indication of healthy competition. The CMA's report was published as the government prepares to launch its \"fuel finder\" scheme, which will allow drivers to compare real-time fuel prices. Petrol was 136.8p per litre last week, according to government tracking , while diesel was 146.1p per litre. The CMA report found that fuel prices had fallen \"significantly\" since it last studied the issue in 2023, largely due to lower oil prices. However, it said profit margins on fuel for both supermarket and non-supermarket retailers were \"historically high\". \"Average fuel margins on a percentage basis have continued to increase for both supermarket and non-supermarket retailers,\" it said. The report noted fuel retailers' arguments that their operating costs had increased, but if this were the case, \"we would expect to see this reflected in declining profit margins\". The CMA said if there was more competition, drivers would see better fuel prices at the pump. Retailers will have to sign up to the planned fuel finder scheme and report price changes within 30 minutes of them being implemented. The CMA said the finder would be accessible through apps and satnavs, and allow drivers to easily compare prices. \"In turn, this should incentivise retailers to compete harder for customers, placing downward pressure on prices.\" The CMA will take action against retailers who breach the conditions of the fuel finder, which could include fines. Dan Turnbull, senior director of markets at the CMA, said: \"Fuel margins remain at persistently high levels – and our new analysis shows operating costs do not explain this. \"We know fuel costs are a big issue for drivers, especially at this time of year with millions making journeys across the country.\" The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said it would \"continue to work constructively with the CMA\" and would engage with the fuel finder scheme. Gordon Balmer, the executive director of the PRA, said: \"Operating costs alone do not account for higher fuel margins, yet retailers continue to face steep rises in labour, taxation, energy and crime. \"Comparisons with historic margins overlook these significant cost increases. \"Pump prices are considerably lower than the peaks observed in 2022 and 2023, corresponding with falls in wholesale fuel prices, indicating strong competition between retailers.\" Both the RAC and the AA said drivers were being overcharged for fuel. The AA said that, since November, the wholesale cost of petrol has fallen more than 7p per litre but the average petrol pump price had fallen by just two-thirds of a penny. \"It comes as millions of drivers take to the road for Christmas and are being overcharged for their fuel,\" the motoring body said. \"Drivers are being taken for a ride at the pumps, as the CMA clearly illustrates.\" RAC head of policy Simon Williams said: \"Many drivers won't be surprised to hear that they're still paying too much for their fuel, especially judging by the complaints we receive about large price variations from area to area.\" He said retailers' arguments of higher operating costs had \"now been clearly rejected\" by the CMA. \"We sincerely hope the new fuel finder scheme, combined with ongoing scrutiny from the CMA, finally leads to increased competition and lower forecourt prices for drivers right across the country.\"",

Another factor adding to demand is that central banks globally are expanding their own physical holdings of gold as a way to counter economic turbulence, reduce reliance on the US dollar, and diversify their own portfolios, according to analysis from Goldman Sachs, which predicted the pattern would continue in 2026.",
      "summary_tr_long": "The gold price has hit another record high, trading above $4,400 (£3,275) an ounce for the first time. The price of the precious metal has risen on expectations the US central bank will cut interest rates further next year, analysts said. Gold started the year worth $2,600 an ounce, but geopolitical tensions, the Trump tariffs and expectations of rate cuts have added to investor demand for safe haven assets, such as gold and other commodities. The prices of other precious metals also rose on Monday, with silver hitting a record high as well. The gold price has risen more than 68% this year, the highest increase since 1979, according to Adrian Ash, director of research at gold bullion marketplace BullionVault. 2025 has seen \"slow-burning trends around interest rates, around war and trade tensions\", Mr Ash said, which have helped to push up the price of gold. \"The precious metals market says that President Trump has really triggered something – and gold has gone crazy this year. \"You've got the trade war, the attacks on the US Federal Reserve and you've got geopolitical tensions, all of those provocations come from Trump,\" he said. After passing the $4,400 an ounce mark on Monday, the spot price of gold hit a high of $4,426.66. Lower interest rate expectations typically mean lower returns for investments such as bonds, so investors look to commodities such as gold and silver to get a return, but also diversify their portfolios. The consensus among analysts currently is that the US will lower interest rates twice in 2026. Another factor adding to demand is that central banks globally are expanding their own physical holdings of gold as a way to counter economic turbulence, reduce reliance on the US dollar, and diversify their own portfolios, according to analysis from Goldman Sachs, which predicted the pattern would continue in 2026. The steady increase in the price of gold across the year could be because it is seen as a way for traders to help shield themselves from the threat of inflation and economic turmoil, Anita Wright, chartered financial planner at Ribble Wealth Management, said. \"When confidence in financial assets and policy stability starts to wobble, gold tends to respond first as the primary monetary metal,\" Ms Wright said. A weaker US dollar has also helped push gold prices higher by making the metal cheaper for overseas buyers. Other precious metals have also had record years. The price of silver also hit a record of $69.44 an ounce on Monday. For 2025 so far, silver is up 138% year-to-date and platinum is at a 17-year high, vastly outperforming gold, underpinned by strong and supply constraints, according to analysts. Unlike gold, the other precious metals are also used widely in industrial manufacturing which helps stoke demand. Separately, oil prices rose on Monday, after the US ordered a \"blockade\" last week of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela. The price of Brent crude rose $1.31 to $61.78 a barrel, while US oil was up $1.25 at $57.77. However, both measures look set to end 2025 at prices lower than where they started the year.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Why the railways often seem to be in such chaos over Christmas Katy Austin Transport correspondent BBC At a rail yard near Milton Keynes, a group of men in orange outfits are making final checks on huge slabs of railway track, preparing them so that they are ready to be installed over Christmas and New Year. Carl Foy has been on duty for roughly 20 of the 27 Christmases in his career. \"We make it as enjoyable as we can and just crack on with the work.\" PA Major engineering works are taking place on Britain's rail network over the Christmas period The £26m project they'll be working on this Christmas is one of the biggest scheduled across the country: Hanslope Junction, a crucial part of the West Coast Main Line, which is wearing out. Each day almost 500 trains use it and an increasing number of faults are causing delays, the repercussions of which ripple throughout the network. It's a giant and complicated jigsaw puzzle of 130 separate track panels - not something that can be done when trains are roaring up and down. So, it will leave passengers with no trains between Milton Keynes and Rugby and Milton Keynes and Northampton not just late on Christmas Eve and on Christmas Day (as is usually the case) but up until the morning of 5 January. It means no direct trains linking London Euston with north-west England and Scotland for 11 full days. In all, 5% of the rail network will be shut down over the festive period - part of a £160m engineering project organised by Network Rail. PA Network Rail, a publicly owned body, manages 20,000 miles of track across England, Scotland, and Wales Many of these are huge jobs, not routine maintenance, that have been long planned, with funding allocated as part of Network Rail's five-yearly business plans. \"Obviously there are a lot less commuters over the Christmas period, I can see why they do it at this time of year, but it's not great if you're trying to get home… to see your friends and family.\" Shutterstock Some passengers have complained about longer journeys caused by the disruption The debate over why works should be scheduled over Christmas is a complex one: on the one hand, train bosses calculate that the effects on people travelling to work will be minimal, given how many businesses shut for Christmas. \"It's the quietest time of year for the railway and our customers, so we squeeze in as much work then to disrupt as few people as possible,\" explains Jake Kelly, a regional managing director at Network Rail. \"All those workers, rightly, are getting paid way over the normal rate they would because they are sacrificing extremely important family and personal time working long hours over that period.\" Shutterstock Rail bosses argue that doing works over Christmas causes less disruption because fewer people are commuting. Mr Kelly acknowledges there is a price: \"It's always a difficult choice, and there is a cost of doing work over Christmas when families across the UK are celebrating.\" But, he says, it's a difficult trade-off between minimising disruption for customers versus cost. Germany and France do it differently When compared with other European countries, Britain is fairly unique (with the exception of Italy) in its \"particularly intensive approach\", as Mr Dennis puts it, to doing this sort of rail work at Easter and Christmas. \"So you can dodge around things more easily… and they can spread their engineering work out a bit more.\" Getty Images In Germany, 'they can spread their engineering work out a bit more,' says Mr Dennis The high level of passenger demand in Britain also poses a challenge. Years of 'mend and make do' Stewart Palmer spent 38 years working on the railway, including spells at Network Rail's predecessor Railtrack, and as the managing director of what was then called South West Trains. In the past – as far back as the post-war period - the money wasn't always there to do the work that was needed and for decades there was a tendency, he says, \"towards mend and make do\". But the legacy of a Hertfordshire rail crash that happened 25 years ago is a reminder of the importance of ensuring that deteriorated rail is replaced in good time. Getty Images The Hatfield disaster of October 2000: a train carrying around 200 passengers derailed, killing four people On a Tuesday in October 2000, a train carrying 12 staff and 170 passengers came to a catastrophic halt outside the town of Hatfield. It's OK for a bit - but eventually it will break.\" It's not only tracks that need looking after, but embankments and drainage along railway lines. Network Rail In November, a train from Glasgow to London derailed near Carlisle after hitting a landslip An independent investigation into the cause of a train derailment will look into a raft of potential issues. Their latest five-year business plan earmarked £2.8bn to help deal with extreme weather and climate change. Cost savings and 'tough choices' Amid all of this, the organisation has committed to make cost savings of £3.9bn. But the regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, has warned that constrained funding forcing Network Rail to spend \"less on renewals and more on life-extending repairs and maintenance\" could mean \"more asset failures and therefore disruption to train services in the long-term\", plus potential higher costs in the future.

      "summary_tr_long": "Rise in gift card scams as victims lose millions Emma Johnson Emma Johnson says she wants to raise awareness after she fell victim to a gift card draining scam Shoppers are being warned to be vigilant as the number of scams involving gift cards rise. Both Trading Standards and Report Fraud, the national fraud reporting body, said better bank protection was pushing criminals to turn to gift cards as a new way to get our money. According to experts, fraudsters target the cards online and in the shop to drain the money from them, or trick people into buying them to transfer money without a trace. Report Fraud, the national body for fraud reporting, believes it has increased by about 25% over the past two years. New figures from the organisation show they had 9,386 reports of gift card fraud in 2023-24, with more than £18.5m lost. Emma Johnson, 48, from Nottinghamshire, said she, her dad and her brother were all victims of a gift card draining scam. They had all separately bought gift cards for her other brother's birthday from the same Tesco store within a week of each other, spending £120 in total. But when he went to use them, it turned out the money had been spent already. She said: \"It's upsetting that you've gone out and bought a present for someone and they haven't actually got anything. \"It's not left me with confidence to buy a gift card in store. \"I don't want this happening to anyone else.\" She believes the cards had been tampered with while in the store and the money drained from them once activated. She urged people to make sure the number in their card matched the number on their receipt. 'Emerging crime' A spokesperson for Tesco said they had a \"robust set of technical and operational measures\" in place to prevent and deal with card tampering. They advised customers to check gift cards carefully before they buy, and to speak to the customer service team if they think they have been victims of fraud. Amanda Wolf, head of Report Fraud, said under reporting made it difficult to know exactly how much it was increasing by, but said their intelligence suggested cases had risen by about a quarter over the past two years. \"It's not unusual when there's an emerging crime type,\" she said. \"But it's absolutely one we are looking at and we are looking to do a deep dive into over the next 12 months.\" She said most of the reports came in around January after the festive period. The ways people are caught out include buying fake online gift cards, accidentally buying a card which has been tampered with or being tricked into buying gift cards for someone. She also said criminals used phishing emails, offering fake gift cards as a prize or a deal. Ms Wolf said: \"Make sure you're buying from reputable sellers, if you're purchasing in person make sure it's not been tampered with. \"If they look poorly made, or don't have visible security features, don't use them and take them back. \"Use two-factor authentication [when shopping online] and check out as a guest to protect your details unless it's a website you recognise and use regularly. \"For that 30 seconds, stop, and think.\" She also said she would like to see gift cards being better protected in shops, including being put behind the till. National Trading Standards Louise Baxter believes some victims of gift card fraud would not think of it as a scam Louise Baxter, head of the National Trading Standards Scams Team, said it was \"not a surprise\" gift card fraud was on the rise, and believed it was likely under reported. She thinks the rise is down to tighter controls on sending money from bank accounts and people not expecting to be scammed with gift cards as it is a \"relatively new\" fraud. \"The criminals are diversifying and trying to find new methods of stealing our money,\" she added. \"Gift cards are difficult to trace, and from the consumer's point of view, how do you prove you didn't just give it to a friend? \"There's more that can be done - we need to ensure we diversify as quickly as the criminals do. \"But sometimes it's like whack-a-mole.\" She said she wanted to see more campaigns to raise awareness, and training for shop staff to check in with people spending lots of money on gift cards. The Home Office said it was \"committed to bringing every perpetrator of this devastating crime to justice\", and would announce a fraud strategy in the new year. \"We're urging everyone to stop and think. No genuine organisation will ever ask you to pay with gift cards,\" a spokesperson added. Hannah Shimko, managing director of the Gift Card and Voucher Association, said the vast majority of gift cards were bought with no difficulty and \"are supported by established consumer protections\". She added retailers and issuers spent a lot on security, transaction monitoring and staff training, and shared intelligence. She previously told the BBC putting gift cards behind the counter would add \"unnecessary friction\" and could lead to a 30% drop in sales, based on industry experience. She added: \"Gift cards continue to be one of the most popular and trusted ways to give, particularly at Christmas, and the industry remains committed to protecting customers and supporting genuine use.\"",

      "summary_tr_long": "Trump says US is pursuing third oil tanker linked to Venezuela Vanessa Buschschlüter and Seher Asaf Watch: Moment US intercepts a second oil tanker off Venezuela The US Coast Guard is still pursuing a vessel in international waters near Venezuela as tensions in the region escalate, President Donald Trump has confirmed. \"We're actually pursuing\" the tanker, Trump said on Monday. \"It came out of Venezuela and it was sanctioned\". US authorities have already seized two oil tankers this month - one of them on Saturday. The Trump administration has accused Venezuela of using oil money to fund drug-related crime, while Venezuela has described the tanker seizures as \"piracy\". The current chase is related to a \"sanctioned dark fleet vessel that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion\", a US official told the BBC's partner CBS News. Late on Saturday the US Coast Guard approached an oil tanker, which US officials said was not flying a valid national flag, the New York Times reported. Confirming the chase on Monday, President Trump said: \"It's moving along. We'll end up getting it.\" The president said that the US would hold onto the seized oil and the vessels carrying it. maybe we'll sell it, maybe we'll keep it\", he said. \"Maybe we'll use it in the strategic reserves. We're keeping it, we're keeping the ships also.\" He had been in touch with the \"big\" American oil companies about the seizures, he added. British maritime risk management group Vanguard identified the tanker as Bella 1, a very large crude oil carrier which reportedly was on its way to Venezuela to pick up oil. The US added the Bella 1 to its sanctions list last year for allegedly \"carrying sanctioned cargo\" . When it added the Bella 1 to its sanctions list, the US Treasury Department accused its registered owner of having links to Iran and of providing support to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The NYT reports the tanker \"did not submit to being boarded\" and fled northeast into the Atlantic Ocean with the US Coast Guard in pursuit. BBC Verify has been analysing 50 distress signals transmitted by Bella 1, the first of which was picked up at 13:44 GMT on 21 December, 461km (286 miles) north east of Antigua and Barbuda. The final distress call was received at 17:13 GMT the same day, around 60km (37 miles) further north east in the Atlantic Ocean. The distance between the two points suggests it was travelling at a speed of around 10 knots (11.5mph). The Bella 1 is the third oil tanker to be targeted by the US in waters off Venezuela. On 10 December, the Coast Guard seized the Skipper, which US Attorney General Pam Bondi said was \"used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela to Iran\". The Skipper has since been taken under escort to Galveston in Texas, where it arrived on Sunday. On Saturday, Coast Guard personnel boarded a tanker with the name Centuries written on its side. While the Centuries does not appear on the US Treasury's list of sanctioned vessels, the White House said that it carried oil from Venezuela's state-run oil company, PDVSA. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that the Centuries was \"operating as part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet to traffic stolen oil and fund the narcoterrorist Maduro regime\". The seizure of the tankers is the latest development in the US's pressure campaign against the government of Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro. Since Trump returned into office in January, the US has doubled the reward it offers for information leading to Maduro's capture, declared his government a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) and last week, ordered a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country. As the Venezuelan government relies heavily on profits from oil exports to finance its spending, this latest move has caused particular outrage with Venezuelan officials. While President Maduro did not refer to the seizure of the Centuries or the pursuit of the Bella 1 directly, he denounced US actions as \"piracy\" in comments he made on Sunday. Maduro has also accused the US of trying to seize Venezuela's oil riches - the South American country has the world's largest proven oil reserves. At Venezuela's request, the United Nations Security will hold an emergency session on Tuesday to discuss what Caracas has described as \"ongoing US aggression\". China on Monday appeared to side with Venezuela with a spokesperson for the foreign ministry denouncing \"unilateral and illegal sanctions that lack a basis in international law or authorisation by the United Nations Security Council\". The spokesperson added that \"Venezuela has the right to develop independently and engage in a mutually beneficial cooperation with other nations\". Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held a phone call with his Venezuelan counterpart on Monday, after which Russia expressed \"full support for and solidarity with the Venezuelan leadership\". Both Russia and China have supported the Venezuelan government financially and militarily for years. But during the current situation, experts say that backing seems to be largely symbolic , with statements being given in support rather than concrete military or financial aid.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Why Croatia's capital wants to hold Europe's best Christmas market Guy Delauney Balkans correspondent AFP via Getty Images Zagreb's Christmas market was voted the best in Europe three years in a row Christmas markets are not just tradition across Europe, they are big businesses that give cities a huge economic boost every December. For Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, it is an effective way of attracting tourists outside of the country's main summer season. The words \"tourism\" and \"Croatia\" are likely to conjure visons of sparkling Adriatic vistas during the hottest months of the year. Tourism accounts for more than a fifth of the economy of this Balkan country, and it is keen to encourage more visitors to arrive outside of the height of summer. At some point way back it was just sun and sea, but now Croatia offers many tourism products all across the country.\" Zagreb Advent, as the capital's Christmas markets and events are collectively known, is the poster child for this approach, with billboards in neighbouring countries urging people to attend. While some cities might limit their offering to a single location, Zagreb Advent is a multi-venue spectacular that takes over large chunks of the centre. \"The entire city has become a festive ground for celebrating Christmas throughout the whole of December,\" says Slavica Olujic Klapcic, who manages one of the Christmas market areas. \"What's really special around here is that each of the locations has its own theme, and it's a little bit different in decoration, and in the content that it offers. So for a visitor, I think it's a good deal, because by taking a walk through Zagreb, you can see many different spots.\" Like other Christmas markets across Europe there are no shortages of the usual seasonal staples, such as sausages and mulled wine. But there are also multiple music stages, craft stalls, vendors offering traditional Croatian food, art installations, and an enormous ice rink. Slavica Olujic Klapcic, who manages one of the market areas, says that Zagreb offers festive variety \"It brings life to Zagreb,\" reckons Zrinka Farina, who is involved with putting on Christmas market events outside the city's historic Hotel Esplanade, as well as a food and music market at nearby Strossmayer Square called Fuliranje – which roughly translates as \"fooling around\". \"We are such a sporty nation, we love to compete – and when we do something, we really want to be the best in the world in it.\" Such has been the effort that the city has put into Zagreb Advent since it was first held in 2014 that it was voted the best Christmas market in Europe for three years in a row , from 2015 to 2017. The competition is organised by travel website European Best Destinations, and Zagreb's success has helped to drive visitor numbers to the city every December. Back in 2014, the city saw 100,198 people stay for at least one night during the last month of the year. By 2024 this had more than doubled to 245,352, which the tourist board says gave the city a €100m ($117m; £88m) economic boost. The Zagreb Advent event is spread across the centre of the city However, Zagreb has a long way to go if it wishes to catch up with Europe's Christmas market heavyweights. It is expected to attract four million visitors this year, with an economic impact of €229m. Meanwhile, Austria's capital Vienna attracts around 2.8 million visitors to its Christmas market, and France's Strasbourg gets two million people. Zagreb's event also has a limited history – it is only in its 11th year. By contrast, Dresden's Christmas market, widely considered to be the world's oldest, was first held in 1434. Strasbourg's began in 1570, Vienna in 1764 and Cologne in 1820. \"They come here from Italy, Spain, Bosnia, Slovenia and even the UK,\" says Lucija Vrkljan, who is working as a steward at the ice rink. \"It's a great place to be,\" says Dario Kozul, the founder of BioMania, a bistro with a stall offering vegan and gluten-free food at the Hotel Esplanade Christmas market. Then we talk about our restaurant, and within the next couple of days, we see them there.\" AFP via Getty Images Dresden's Christmas market was first held in 1434 Marko Peric, dean of the Faculty of Tourism at Croatia's University of Rijeka, agrees that Zagreb Advent brings \"unusually high\" numbers of arrivals and overnight stays in December. But he cautions that the rest of Croatia's heavy reliance on the summer season is a weakness that still needs to be addressed. And we could use other types of events like carnival in February, or sporting events.\" Tourism Minister Tonci Glavina insists that Croatia is making moves in the right direction. He points out that visitor numbers over July and August were actually slightly down on the same period in 2024. But the country is still on course for a record-breaking year, thanks to significant growth either side of the summer peak, with around 5% more arrivals in June and September. This, says the minister, is \"just perfect\", as is the 10% year-on-year rise over the first week of December. \"We are transforming Croatia to be a sustainable tourism destination, meaning about the same number of guests in peak season, developing the shoulder seasons, and of course developing other parts of the country to be main tourism destinations.\" Zagreb Advent has already shown the benefits. Although that may not be the first thing that springs to a visitor's mind with all the traditional Croatian treats on offer.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Megan Lawton Business reporter AFP via Getty Images One UK study found that 34% of advertised vacancies didn't really exist The phrase \"ghost jobs\" might sound like something from Halloween, but it refers to the practice of employers advertising vacancies that don't exist. In some cases the positions may have already been filled, but in others the job might not have ever been available. Up to 22% of jobs advertised online last year were positions listed with no intent to hire, according to a study across the US, UK and Germany by recruitment software provider Greenhouse. A separate UK study put the figure even higher, at 34%. Meanwhile, the most recent official data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that while there were 7.2 million job vacancies back in August, only 5.1 million people were hired. Why are firms posting ghost jobs, and what is being done to tackle the problem? In the US, a jobhunting tech worker called Eric Thompson is making politicians in Washington DC increasingly aware of the issue. In October of last year Mr Thompson, who has more than 20 years of experience in the tech sector, was made redundant from a start-up. He spent the following two months unsuccessfully applying for hundreds of jobs. It dawned on Mr Thompson that some of the advertised jobs simply didn't exist. The experience led him to set up a working group calling for legislation to ban the practice of fake job adverts in the US. Continuing to meet with members of the US Congress, he has led the formulation of proposed legislation called The Truth in Job Advertising & Accountability Act. This calls for expiration dates for listings when hiring is paused or completed, auditable hiring records, and penalties for employers who post misleading or non-existent roles. He has also started a petition, which has so far generated over 50,000 signatures. Alongside the signatures, he says he receives messages from people describing how ghost jobs have chipped away at their confidence and impacted their mental health. The New Jersey and California state legislatures are also looking at banning ghost jobs. Eric Thompson Eric Thompson wants US politicians to ban ghost jobs The Canadian province of Ontario, is however, leading the way. As from 1 January companies will have to disclose whether an advertised vacancy is actively being filled. Ontario is also moving to tackle the separate recruitment issue of \"ghosting\", whereby companies don't reply to applicants. Firms in the province with more than 25 employees will now have to reply to someone they have interviewed within 45 days. However, they still won't need to contact anyone they didn't choose to interview. Deborah Hudson, an employment lawyer based in Toronto, says she's already been approached by companies \"trying to get it right\". \"My cynical side, after almost 20 years in this field, wonders how they're actually going to monitor and regulate this. But if people run into problems, they can make a complaint and it will be looked into.\" Elsewhere in Canada, and in the US and UK, there is no legal requirement to reply to candidates. Nor are there any current moves in the UK to tackle either ghost jobs or recruitment ghosting. Ailish Davies, a jobseeker from Leicester in the UK, says that being ghosted by small firms and big corporations alike is \"soul destroying\". She adds: \"The amount of time I've spent putting effort into tailoring an application, to hear nothing back, it knocks you down.\" Ms Davies, who has been working in marketing for more than 10 years, describes one occasion where a hiring manager asked for her availability for an interview, and after she replied, she never heard back. \"Employers should treat job seekers with more compassion because the current job market is not a nice place to be.\" Jasmine Escalera is a career coach and recruitment expert based in Miami. \"They kept seeing the same job posted again and again, and asking me if they should reapply. The morale of any job seeker gets crushed.\" newNsight Photography Jasmine Escalera says that some firms may be trying to pretend that they are growing So why are companies posting ghost jobs? \"We surveyed hiring managers, and found some companies post positions to create a talent pool,\" she says. \"It isn't that they don't want to hire, it's more they're not hiring immediately. \"Others, we found, were inflating numbers and trying to show their company is growing, even if it's not.\" Dr Escalera adds that she has also heard examples of companies posting jobs to obtain and sell data. Whatever the reason for the fake adverts, Dr Escalera cautions that it is giving governments a false picture of job markets, which has negative, real-world consequences. \"We use data to develop policy and understand what market trends look like, and so if that data is somehow skewed, then we're not able to create the policies or provide the support that job seekers and employees need right now,\" she says. For jobhunters hoping to avoid ghost jobs, Dr Escalera advises that they try to network with hiring managers. \"You will know a position is real if you're having conversations with real humans who work at that organisation,\" she says. \"If you see that a job is being posted multiple times during a certain time frame, or that the job posting has been open for a while, then it is possible the posting is staying open because the job is not intended to be filled.\" Read more global business stories",

      "summary_tr_long": "Why this month's inflation figure may be good news for you Kevin Peachey Cost of living correspondent Getty Images On the face of it, there is relatively little festive cheer for your finances in the latest inflation figures. Prices have risen by 3.2% compared with a year ago. If you filled your virtual shopping bag with goods and services at a cost of £100 a year ago, the same selection will now cost £103.20. The rate of rising prices is well above the Bank of England's target of 2%, and some items are still rocketing up in price. Chocolate, arguably central to the family diet at Christmas, is 17% more expensive than a year ago. But, crucially, there are now clear signs that prices are going up at a slower rate. That bodes well for next year, and more immediately for the cost of borrowing. And, with essentials driving the slowdown, the latest data will be welcomed by those who feel particularly stretched by the cost of living. Pasta, sugar and flour prices fall The rate of inflation, which charts the rising cost of living, has overcome its recent mini-peak, according to analysts. The mountainous height of inflation was in October 2022 when the rate hit 11.1%. The rate then fell, but there was an uptick in the late summer of 2025, reaching 3.8%. And it was the price of food - an essential for consumers - driving November's drop in inflation. Food and non-alcoholic drinks rose by 4.2% in the year to November, compared to 4.9% in October. Alcohol and tobacco were up 4% compared to 5.9% in October. Moving in the opposite direction to chocolate, and beef and veal (which rose by nearly 28% in a year), were olive oil (down 16%) as well as drops in price for flours, pasta and sugar. Importantly, food is essential spending. When the price rises slow, this is much better news for those on lower incomes who see a bigger proportion of their income spent on things that it is impossible to do without. Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said this was also helping the overall inflation rate drop faster than expected: \"It has been following the path the Bank of England had forecast - peaking in September and gradually moving south.\" Will the good news last? The reasons for slowing price rises are often specific to individual items. For example, the drop in the price of olive oil is primarily the result of a recovery in harvests after some particularly bad years of heatwaves and drought in Greece and Turkey. Clothing and footwear prices fell by 0.6% in the year to November compared to a rise of 0.3% in October. This has been linked to shops bringing forward Black Friday discounts due to weak sales as shoppers struggle with the cost of living pressures. Lucy says home bakers are making the most of what they have Consumers, too, have changed their habits owing to the financial climate of recent years. Lucy Fairs, who helps run a cake-sharing social club, called Band of Bakers in Camberwell, London, said that, over the last five years, they had started using what they already had in their cupboards, rather than buying extra special ingredients. Costa Christou says he chooses recipes carefully \"When I chose a recipe for today, I thought of the theme - but, more so, I thought of what I already had in my pantry,\" said club member Costa Christou. Impact on borrowing and saving The rising cost of goods and services has an impact on the money you save or earn. Inflation erodes the spending power of money you've got saved and - unless you get a pay rise - of your salary. Analysts say the latest inflation data strengthens the likelihood of a cut in interest rates by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee on Thursday. That should make it cheaper for consumers to borrow money, but bring lower returns for savers. \"Lower inflation is good news for household budgets, but it is a different story for savers,\" said Sally Conway, savings commentator at Shawbrook Bank. \"Some savings will inevitably take a hit over Christmas. Once the dust settles, it's worth checking whether remaining cash is working hard enough.\" Policymakers are trying to encourage more people to invest their money in stocks and shares - which they say is likely to bring higher returns over time than cash savings. It is why the Financial Conduct Authority has given the go-ahead for targeted support - a scheme that, for the first time, allows banks and financial firms to give suggestions about where to invest your money.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Spain's commitment to renewable energy may be in doubt Guy Hedgecoe Aragón, north-eastern Spain Juan Antonio Domínguez Spain gets more than half of its electricity from wind and solar On the edge of the sleepy town of Figueruelas, a single, vast wind turbine spins around, casting its shadow over the buildings nearby. It's a reminder of the importance of renewable electricity in this windswept area of Aragón, in north-eastern Spain, whose plains are host to many of the country's wind and solar energy farms. Figueruela's status as a symbol of Spain's green transition has been further boosted recently, as work starts nearby on the construction of a vast factory that will produce batteries for electric vehicles. Chinese firm CATL and the Netherlands-based Stellantis are investing a combined €4bn ($4.7bn; £3.5bn) in the facility. Yao Jing, China's ambassador in Spain, described it as \"one of the biggest Chinese investments Europe has ever seen\". \"We're in Aragón, where there's wind all year round, there are lots of hours of sunshine, and we are surrounded by wind turbines and solar panels,\" he says. \"Those [energy sources] will be crucial in generating electricity for the new factory, and I understand that was the key reason for building it here in Figueruelas.\" Luis Bertol Moreno says the new battery factory will transform the town of Figueruelas The factory can be seen as vindication of Spain's energy model, which prioritises renewable sources. In 2017, renewables contributed just a third of Spain's electricity production, but last year they represented 57%. By 2030, the government wants them to contribute 81% of electricity output. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez summarised his government's approach as he delivered a riposte to US President Donald Trump's pro-fossil fuel \"Dig, baby, dig\" slogan. This was in great part due to an 28 April blackout that left homes, businesses, government buildings, public transport, schools and universities in the dark across Spain and neighbouring Portugal for several hours. With the government unable to offer a full explanation for the outage, the country's energy mix became a fiercely-debated political issue. Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the conservative opposition, accused the government of \"fanaticism\" in pursuing its green agenda, suggesting that an over-reliance on renewables might have caused the incident. The fact that, a week before the blackout, solar generation in mainland Spain registered a record 61.5% of the electricity mix has fuelled such claims. Yet the government and national grid operator Red Eléctrica have both denied that the outage was linked to the preponderance of renewable energy sources in Spain. \"We have operated the system with higher renewable rates [previously] with no effect on the security of the system,\" says Concha Sánchez, head of operations for Red Eléctrica. \"Definitely it's not a question of the rate of renewables at that moment.\" Ms Sánchez said the blackout was caused by a combination of issues, including an \"unknown event\" in the system moments before, which saw anomalous voltage oscillations. However, Red Eléctrica and the government are still awaiting reports on the incident that they hope will determine the exact cause. Meanwhile, since April, Spain's electricity mix has been modified somewhat, with greater reliance on natural gas, reinforcing the notion that the country is at an energy crossroads. AFP via Getty Images Work on the new battery factory was officially started last month, accompanied by a press conference Spain's nuclear industry, which currently contributes around 20% of national electricity, has been particularly vocal since the blackout, pushing back against government plans to close the country's five nuclear plants between 2027 and 2035. With many European countries undergoing a nuclear renaissance, the planned closures make Spain something of an outlier. The companies that own the Almaraz plant in south-western Spain, due to be the first to shut down, have requested a three-year extension to its life until 2030. Ignacio Araluce, president of Foro Nuclear, an association that represents the industry, says Spain is the only country in the world that is scheduling the closure of nuclear plants that are in operation. Mr Araluce praises renewable sources because they only require natural elements to generate electricity, but points out that they are not able to operate around the clock or when weather is unfavourable. The answer, he added, is \"with a source like nuclear, that is not producing CO2, that is producing all hours of the year\". The far-right Vox, criticising what it saw as a lack of explanation by the government for the April blackout, recently described nuclear power as \"a crucial source of stability\". AFP via Getty Images The current government is committed to closing the country's five nuclear power plants Ms Sánchez acknowledges that there is room for improvement for Spain's electricity model, pointing to the Iberian peninsula's relative isolation from the European grid compared to most of its EU neighbours. \"While we have taken a good path when it comes to renewable installation, we cannot say the same regarding storage,\" she says. \"We need to foster storage installation.\" Spain's political panorama adds an element of uncertainty to its energy future. The Socialist-led coalition has been mired in corruption scandals and its parliamentary majority appears to have collapsed in recent weeks, raising the possibility of a snap election in the coming months. The town's population, of just 1,000, is due to increase dramatically, with 2,000 Chinese workers scheduled to arrive to help build the new battery plant, which is expected to create up to 35,000 indirect jobs once it starts operating. \"These kinds of investments revitalise the area, they revitalise the construction sector, hostelry,\" says local man Manuel Martín.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Japan is facing a dementia crisis – can technology help? Suranjana Tewari Asia Business Correspondent, Tokyo BBC Scientists at Waseda University in Tokyo are developing caregiving robots Last year, more than 18,000 older people living with dementia left their homes and went missing in Japan. Police say such cases have doubled since 2012. Elderly people aged 65 and over now make up nearly 30% of Japan's population - the second-highest proportion in the world after Monaco, according to the World Bank. The crisis is further compounded by a shrinking workforce and tight limits on foreign workers coming in to provide care. Japan's government has identified dementia as one of its most urgent policy challenges, with the Health Ministry estimating that dementia-related health and social care costs will reach 14 trillion yen ($90bn; £67bn) by 2030 - up from nine trillion yen in 2025. In its most recent strategy, the government has signalled a stronger pivot toward technology to ease the pressure. Across the country, people are adopting GPS-based systems to keep track of those who go missing. Some regions offer wearable GPS tags that can alert authorities the moment a person leaves a designated area. In some towns, convenience-store workers receive real-time notifications – a kind of community safety net that can locate a missing person within hours. Robot caregivers and AI Other technologies aim to detect dementia earlier. Fujitsu and Acer Medical's aiGait uses AI to analyse posture and walking patterns, picking up early signs of dementia – shuffling while walking, slower turns or difficulty standing – generating skeletal outlines clinicians can review during routine check-ups. \"Early detection of age-related diseases is key,\" says Hidenori Fujiwara, a Fujitsu spokesperson. \"If doctors can use motion-capture data, they can intervene earlier and help people remain active for longer.\" Meanwhile, researchers at Waseda University are developing AIREC, a 150kg humanoid robot designed to be a \"future\" caregiver. It can help a person put on socks, scramble eggs and fold laundry. The scientists at Waseda University hope that in the future, AIREC will be able to change adult nappies and prevent bedsores in patients. Toshio Morita (R) works at the Restaurant of Mistaken Orders Similar robots are already being used in care homes to play music to residents or guide them in simple stretching exercises. They are also monitoring patients at night - placed under mattresses to track sleep and conditions - and cutting back on the need for humans doing the rounds. Although humanoid robots are being developed for the near future, Assistant Professor Tamon Miyake says the level of precision and intelligence required will take at last five years before they are safely able to interact with humans. \"It requires full-body sensing and adaptive understanding - how to adjust for each person and situation,\" he says. Emotional support is also part of the innovation drive. Poketomo, a 12cm tall robot, can be carried around in a bag or can fit into a pocket. It reminds users to take medication, tells you how to prepare in real time for the weather outside and offers conversation for those living alone, which its creators say helps to ease social isolation. and to use new technology to help solve those problems,\" Miho Kagei, development manager from Sharp told the BBC. While devices and robots offer new ways to assist, human connection remains irreplaceable. \"Robots should supplement, not substitute, human caregivers,\" Mr Miyake, the Waseda University scientist said. \"While they may take over some tasks, their main role is to assist both caregivers and patients.\" At the Restaurant of Mistaken Orders in Sengawa, Tokyo, founded by Akiko Kanna, people stream in to be served by patients suffering from dementia. Inspired by her father's experience with the condition, Ms Kanna wanted a place where people could remain engaged and feel purposeful. Toshio Morita, one of the café's servers, uses flowers to remember which table ordered what. Despite his cognitive decline, Mr Morita enjoys the interaction. For his wife, the café provides respite and helps keep him engaged. Kanna's café illustrates why social interventions and community support remain essential. Technology can provide tools and relief, but meaningful engagement and human connection are what truly sustain people living with dementia. I like meeting all sorts of people,\" Mr Morita says. \"Everyone's different - that's what makes it fun.\" Getty Images Sharp's Poketomo robot has been designed to give companionship to patients Additional reporting by Jaltson Akkanath Chummar",

Director of Public Health Services Nicola Brink said it was important to remember personal wellbeing matters and not get overwhelmed by the festive celebrations. \"We must not forget to be kind to ourselves and take opportunities to relax too,\" she said. Her suggestions include eating well, taking time to slow down - even on the busiest days - and asking for support if needed. 'It's ok to say no' She advised people to \"pause and breathe\" and take a few minutes to slow down. \"It also helps to stay connected with others, whether at a community event or catching up with a friend on the phone, which can just lift your mood and remind you that you're not alone,\" she said. Ms Brink also suggested that islanders try to find joy in the \"small things\" such as the lights in Guernsey as well as making sure to set boundaries. \"It's okay to say no to gatherings, traditions or commitments that leave you feeling drained,\" she said. \"Simply say 'no, it's not for me'.\" Dr Beverley Tachon, who is the psychologist and service manager for Healthy Minds, said: \"Christmas can be hard for many people and for lots of different reasons. \"If you can, talk to a trusted friend or family member.\" She said talking to someone can make people \"feel more supported and less alone\". Jo Cottell, Guernsey Mind chief executive, said people have control over how they spend the holidays and it was important to prioritise wellbeing. She said the season can bring challenges including money worries, family conflict, unrealistic expectations and feelings of isolation.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Budget 2025: What's the best and worst that could happen for Labour? Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC Any big red box moment is risky. The prime minister will revel in the argument for scrapping the cap in a big speech on Monday, suggesting it's not just the right thing to do for those in need, but the right move for the economy now and into the future. In other words, giving Labour MPs something many of them - not just the left-wing fringe, but government ministers like Bridget Phillipson - had argued for, has cheered them right up after months of unhappiness and anxiety-fuelled conversations about what Keir Starmer stands for and whether he is up to the job. But with a majority as big as they won in July 2024, it's solving a problem they ought never to have had. From a political point of view, another government source says \"there'll be a body language change and we are going to enjoy the fight.\" If - and it is still an if - this calm can last, politics can settle down and businesses might feel more confident. But for one member of the government, the best-case scenario \"has to be an uptick in the polls and a stronger message for May\", referring to a mega set of elections in Scotland, Wales and across different parts of England where Labour is roundly expected to get hammered, and Keir Starmer's job is expected to hang in the balance. But one party insider grimly joked, after this week: \"The best-case scenario for the PM is that he gets to May, and then there is a failed challenge.\" What about the worst-case scenario? You'd calmed everybody down, bond yields happy, Labour backbenchers happy, then you throw it all up in the air again!\" Separate to the Budget process, unions and business and ministers had been trying to find a compromise over how long workers would have to be in a job before getting the right to claim they'd been unfairly sacked. It's not complicated and it's made the Labour-trade union relationship more difficult and created unnecessary tension for Starmer and Reeves in the event of things tanking after local elections.\" In other words, leadership watch out. Growth is predicted to be still sludgy for years, slower than expected all the way up until 2030. One city figure told me: \"The left side of Labour might hate business but that's what pays for the things they want - it cannot fund the triple lock, welfare, and the NHS unless the economy grows.\" Another senior business figure told me: \"I think we are bit screwed aren't we - by end of the decade we are going to spend nearly 400 billion on pensions and welfare - growth is clearly not at the top of the list.\" The minimum wage is going up. Pointing to decisions on Heathrow and new nuclear, they hit back: \"If those businesses want to employ decent people in the years to come, it's quite a good idea those children don't go hungry when they are growing up.\" PA Wire Starmer himself will insist the government is just as committed to growth as it's always been in his speech next week, and is likely to emphasise his desire to get rid of red tape and speed up the planning system. Multiple sources suggest Labour switching to a more traditional focus to please its party removes what sometimes felt like a contradiction - a focus on helping business make money at the same time as pursuing its own values. One former minister suggested that since the high-tax, high-spend Budget, the difference between the two parties was now as clear as it was in 1992. As one business leader suggested, the increase to the minimum wage and increased taxes could mean \"everyone will just not hire - there's nothing to create confidence for us when we desperately need it.\" The Treasury might hope something else turns up and the long-term picture improves, perhaps because of advances in AI, perhaps because of planning reforms, perhaps because of, who knows. That's not just because having repeatedly promised not to increase income taxes, the chancellor is doing precisely that by freezing the level where you start paying tax, breaking certainly the spirit if not the precise letter of the party's election manifesto. Getty Images Richard Hughes, chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility (left), flanked by Andy King and Prof David Miles Repeatedly, and unusually publicly, the chancellor talked about how changes to the financial picture would leave her with no choice but to take those pesky, difficult decisions, i.e. Many briefings were deliberate, including suggestions just last week that the numbers from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had come in more or less at the last moment, looking more rosy than had been expected . What we now know is that the OBR, which released this information late on Friday, had weeks before told Rachel Reeves that because more tax had come in, there wasn't actually a hole in her finances after all. But even one Labour insider questions whether the government crossed the line: \"Everyone knows the game, but there's a line between rolling the pitch and simply misleading the public and the lobby.\" In the worst-case scenario, the very messy Budget process has damaged trust in the government even more, and given their opponents more reason to hurl accusations of bad faith and bad behaviour right in heir face.

Bloomberg via Getty Images By September of this year, suggestions of the Treasury's own frustration with the OBR were circulating Ultimately, the mini-Budget of 2022 showed how much the OBR's role is respected in the markets: this was stressed by the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey at emergency meetings in Downing Street at the height of that crisis.",
      "summary_tr_long": "Faisal Islam Economics editor BBC Budget days used to be symbolised by the chancellor of the exchequer smiling and holding aloft the famous Red Box outside Number 11. Now a debate is bubbling about whether this small department, known as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - and staffed mainly by young intellectuals and civil servants - is in fact too powerful, with claims from some that it is essentially half-running the government economic policy. If she wants to change the policies, she can change the policies.\" Getty Images A debate is bubbling about whether the department, known to few outside this closed world, is in fact too powerful Officially the OBR monitors the UK government's spending plans and performance, and releases forecasts for the economy and public finances twice a year, (alongside the Budget and Spring Statement), which assess whether the government is likely to meet the rules it has set over tax and spending. When Labour entered office in 2024 it passed a new law giving it new powers to initiate forecasts, even when the government does not ask it to. This was prompted by the Conservatives' mini-Budget of September 2022, which promised big tax cuts but did not say how they would be paid for, and spooked financial markets. At the time I reported that the then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng had brushed away the offer from the OBR of an official forecast, which could either have given some comfort to the markets that the plan had been fully costed, or impeded the Truss administration's ability to announce those policy changes. WPA Pool/Getty Images The Conservatives' mini-Budget of September 2022, which promised big tax cuts but did not say how they would be paid for, spooked financial markets Empowering the OBR was, in fact, part of Rachel Reeves's plan. When I asked the chancellor about a statement from the OBR, issued two months earlier, that \"promises made are constantly not kept\" on tax and spending, Reeves replied: \"The OBR have got an important job to do and their job is to produce forecasts on the economy - not to give a running commentary on government policy.\" Office for Budget Responsibility Richard Hughes, the former Treasury mandarin, educated at Oxford and Harvard, is at the helm of the OBR Yet the message I received from that exchange with Richard Hughes was clear: the OBR's true power is not at all at the level its critics suggest. \"They are inescapably political.\" At the end of October, one month before the Budget, the OBR is understood to have lowered its forecast for productivity - a measure of the output of the economy per hour worked - by 0.3 percentage points. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, for every 0.1 percentage point downgrade in the productivity forecast, government borrowing would increase by £7bn in 2029-30 - meaning a 0.3 point cut could add £21bn to Rachel Reeves's Budget black hole. For example, if this downgrade had been given when, say, Jeremy Hunt was chancellor, it would have been far more difficult - impossible says the current Treasury - for the Conservatives to deliver the pre-election National Insurance cuts that he did in March 2024. \"A body designed to police cuts is now being asked to referee a strategy for growth, and it simply isn't built for the task.\" But Richard Hughes told me in March he was simply accounting for the numbers, and that it is the chancellor and Parliament that have £3 trillion a year worth of power to make decisions on either raising revenues or spending them. A need for 'reconstruction' In late September 2008, as the world and Britain especially was convulsed by its biggest ever financial crisis, the Conservative Party published an obscure pamphlet titled \"Reconstruction\". British building society Bradford & Bingley had just been nationalised; US investment bank Lehman Brothers had collapsed a fortnight before; and half the British banking system was being prepared for state bailouts, and the pamphlet reflected what researchers were saying was best practice in the field of fiscal policy. Getty Images US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008 The office was first established by the coalition government in 2010, then put on a permanent statutory footing in March 2011. Take the fallout after Robert Chote, then chair of the OBR, published a chart showing spending levels at their lowest since the 1930s. AFP via Getty Images Chancellor George Osborne predicted that appointing independent economists was likely going to cause the coalition government some problems Since then, the former Prime Minister Liz Truss, has made claims that a \"deep state\" played a part in bringing down her brief government - \"the economic establishment, who fundamentally don't want the status quo to change\", as she put it.

      "summary_tr_long": "The curious case of why Poundland is struggling during a cost-of-living crisis Emma Simpson Business correspondent BBC The residents of Peckham in south London have just lost their Poundland store, which closed this week after 11 years of trading. Rye Lane in south London - a lively, multicultural high street - is losing its pound shop, after 11 years of trading More than 100 of its shops have either shut or been earmarked for closure since the summer. That's after the business was sold in June for a nominal £1 amid \"challenging trading conditions\". It does have a turnaround plan but by the end of the process, Poundland expects to end up with between 650 and 700 shops, compared with the 800-odd it had at the start of this year. Elsewhere on UK high streets, the Original Factory shop is struggling and has shut at least 22 shops. And B&M Bargains, one of the UK's biggest discount chains, has launched a turnaround plan due to weak sales. Bloomberg via Getty Images Poundland was sold in June for a nominal £1 amid 'challenging trading conditions' All big retailers have faced a substantial increase in employer costs because of last year's Budget, but it's more difficult when you're selling the cheapest products because there's less wiggle room to absorb the extra costs, or to pass them on to customers. After inflation, selling a product for £1 in 1990, when Poundland began, is the equivalent of selling it for 40p today. The entrepreneur who cracked the model Chris Edwards, a businessman from Yorkshire, has spent more than 50 years working in retail's bargain basement. He and his son were the team behind Poundworld, which they sold for £150m 10 years ago. In 2019, they started a new chain, OneBelow, selling everything for £1 or less - but three years later they had to change tactics. It's now called OneBeyond, with almost everything at £1 or above. \"What tipped us over the edge was the [post-pandemic] shipping crisis, when we couldn't get containers through and the cost of freight was ridiculous.\" 'We realised the pound game wasn't going to work any more,' says Chris Edwards But Mr Edwards says his business model still works: in his view, it comes down to experience, negotiating skill and getting the mix of products just right. As for making economics stack up, he says sometimes he is able to secure cheap prices on UK stock from big-name brands but when he can't he sacrifices profits in order to attract shoppers. The father and son duo grew Poundworld into a chain of more than 300 shops, before selling it in 2015 to an American investor. \"They tried to sell other things but not in a controlled way like we do it.\" Wilko also lost its way, tipping into administration in 2023 with the loss of thousands of jobs. The business had drifted further and further from its original premise - lots of products for £1 - and was selling them instead at a wide range of different prices. This has meant closing 57 unprofitable stores and negotiating steep rent cuts with landlords, where it can. Another 48 shops are being shut as these landlords have decided to take back the leases and find new occupiers instead. The main budget chains now have 3,400 shops across the UK, according to data analytics firm, Geolytix. The number of them more than doubled between 2009 and 2015 - but numbers have risen only slightly since then. Back in 2009 the UK was in the teeth of a recession, following the global financial crisis. Getty High street shopping has evolved since the 1970s, when shops like Woolworths were hugely popular Discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl also grew rapidly during this period, luring millions of customers away from the established grocers with cheaper prices. By 2019, much of the budget store growth was happening in out-of-town locations and retail parks, a trend accelerated by the pandemic. Sales figures are hard to come by, but Mintel data suggests 30% of online shoppers in the UK shopped with Temu in the year to September 2025, while 14% shopped with AliExpress and 3% with DHGate, another Chinese marketplace, in the same period. AFP via Getty Images Chinese brands like Shein sell products in bulk from their huge factories - inside one of their enormous factories Amazon has also got in on the act by launching its own ultra-low-cost shopping section, Amazon Haul. So this sort of wave of low-cost influence from outside of the UK isn't slowing down, and I think there's much more to come.\" There are also new selling platforms like TikTok Shop, Catherine Shuttleworth points out, where you can find people advertising anything from sweets and toilet paper to pillows. \"It's not just the standard retailer they used to go to - it could be anybody.\" Getty Images On selling platforms like TikTok Shop, you can find people advertising anything from sweets, pillows and toilet paper to beauty products The danger for traditional budget shops is that they will no longer be seen as being the cheapest in the market. The Range has continued to expand, opening 60 standalone stores this year, after acquiring the DIY chain Homebase out of administration. \"For some people, budget shopping is a hobby,\" she adds, \"but for others it's an absolute necessity.\" BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.",

      "summary_tr_long": "The £5.30 orange juice that tells the story of why supermarket prices are sky high Faisal Islam Economics editor BBC Listen to Faisal read this article There has been more than a bitter twang in the glasses at British breakfast tables. Only five years ago, a typical supermarket own-label carton of orange juice could be bought for 76p for 1 litre. That's a rise of 134% since 2020, and it's up 29% just in the past year. In cafes and restaurants it's a similar story - with £3.50 to £4 now a standard price point for a glass of basic OJ. One colleague was outraged to be sent a bill for £9 for a glass of hangover-busting orange juice and lemonade at an unassuming little restaurant in Kent. Asked why so much, she was told that the orange juice - albeit freshly squeezed - accounted for £5.30 of the price. All of this is compounded by grocery price inflation which, after hitting 17.5% in 2023, came down (to around 5.7% in August) but is rising once again. Plus new figures for overall inflation released today put it at 3.8% - marking the 12th month in a row it is above the Bank of England’s 2% target. Hulton Archive/Getty Images Orange juice from concentrate was commercialised by Minute Maid Orange juice is nearly 90% water. WW2 ended before the troops got to try it, but it ended up being commercialised by what became the American soft drink giant, Minute Maid. TV Times/ Getty Images/ Screen Archives Minute Maid orange juice was popularised by Bing Crosby Flash forward to today and an estimated 2.5 billion gallons of orange juice are drunk each year - with about a tenth of that in the UK, where the market is still growing. His firm Gerald McDonald and Co is named after his great-grandfather, a pioneer who was importing orange concentrate as far back as the 1940s from what was then British-mandate Palestine. But prices reached extraordinary heights in global markets, rising from $1(75p) to $1.50 (£1.12) per lb over the last decade, to a record $5.30 per lb by the end of last year. \"For such a major commodity to go from $2 to $7 is insane, but it took a while to filter through to consumers.\" Until 2023 the rise in orange juice prices was disguised among food inflation in general, explains Philip Coverdale, an industry expert at consultancy firm GlobalData. (Plus Spain too suffered from weather-related production slumps, including the floods in Valencia last October.) AFP via Getty Images Spain has suffered from weather-related production slumps Even within Brazil the market is concentrated in the hands of huge industrialised conglomerates. \"It's very difficult to get oranges out of Florida [because of the shortages] and it's too expensive.\" VW Pics/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Spain also grows oranges - but Valencia and Seville oranges are mostly exported as fruit, rather than concentrate One of the leading suppliers to Tropicana sold off some of its land earlier this year to build homes. One of Tropicana's recent product innovations in the US has been to launch an \"essentials\" brand of orange juice \"blends\" - combining orange, apple and pear juice - at a lower price. US exports of orange juice to Canada have slumped to a 20-year low after Canada put counter-tariffs on US exports. The Trump administration has also settled on a 10% tariff on orange juice coming from Brazil, which will feed into US supermarket prices. In 2024, the UK eliminated tariffs on some imports produced from fruit grown outside Britain. Getty Images The Trump administration has put a 10% tariff on orange juice coming from Brazil Then there are new regulations around packaging, further adding to the pressures. Yet it coincides with sinking demand: global consumption of orange juice is now down 30% from a peak two decades ago. AFP via Getty Images South Africa grows oranges but its supplies are small Ultimately, however, orange juice is a staple that supermarkets have long been used to selling at low prices. And the price spikes to £2 a carton could, with for example better weather, simply reverse. \"The volatility in the harvest appears to have reduced,\" says Giles Hurley, UK CEO of Aldi, \"Our buying team are doing everything they can to ensure that that saving is passed on to consumers.\" Others in the supply chain are less convinced, given that much of the frozen concentrate was bought at last year's high prices. Butter is up almost 19%, and chocolate and coffee 15% and milk over 12%, all according to the Office for National Statistics. It's difficult to uncover relationships between retailers and manufacturers or farmers and the use of contracts.\" There is also a broader question that goes well beyond orange juice: do consumers in the UK need to simply accept the fact that as a densely populated small country with limited agriculture, a changing climate means the UK will be increasingly exposed to food price shocks? A 2024 government report on food security noted: \"The UK continues to be highly dependent on imports to meet consumer demand for fruit, vegetables and seafood... \"Many of the countries the UK imports these foods from are subject to their own climate-related challenges and sustainability risks.\" And so it could be that this is only the start of a wild ride on what we pay for our food and drink.

In 2019, he dressed up in a \"libertarian superhero\" costume, purporting to be from Liberland - a land where no taxes are paid. In 2018, he smashed a piñata of the Central Bank on live television. According to official data, inflation in 2023 topped 211% annually - Milei took office in December of that year. Roughly 40% of the population lived in poverty. Yet nearly two years on, the headline figures are vastly different: Argentina recorded its first fiscal surplus in 14 years and inflation, which had hit triple figures annually, has tumbled to roughly 36%. The UK Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch called the measures Milei has taken a \"template\" for a future Conservative government. And in the US, President Donald Trump described Milei as \"my favourite president\". Although that recently slipped, Washington's decision last week to swap $20bn (£15bn) in dollars for pesos, effectively propping up Argentina's currency with International Monetary Fund (IMF) backing, is a sign Milei's fiscal shock therapy has appeased international lenders. \"The adjustment in the end was directed at the working classes, not the caste.\" Reuters Milei's reforms have prompted heated protests Milei's critics argue that the price of his changes have been recession, job losses, weaker public services and declining household budgets. With midterm elections looming on 26 October, Argentina is about to deliver its verdict: will Milei be punished for doing what he set out to do — and could losing political support completely unravel his economic gains? Argentines feeling the cost Around 700 miles from the capital in the Misiones province, tea farmer Ygor Sobol looks anxious. Now I am completely without employees.\" For three generations his family has grown yerba mate, a drink popular with Argentines, but since Milei deregulated his industry by scrapping minimum prices, he says that his crops have become worth less than the cost of producing them. \"I have environmental controls, labour controls - we don't pay people $80 (£60) a month, or have 16-hour work days that might be allowed in places like Bangladesh or Vietnam. \"Our sector lost more than 10,000 direct jobs. If you add indirect jobs, there are many more.\" Mr Galfione also blames rising costs of utilities, health and schools for reducing the disposable income of average people, and in turn making them less likely to buy clothes. Public spending was high, even before the Covid-19 pandemic. Argentina, still, owes £31bn in debt to the IMF. Or didn't recognise that inflation was a product of so much public spending.\" EPA - EFE/REX/Shutterstock Opponents of Javier Milei say ordinary people have been left with less disposable income Inflation ate away the peso currency's purchasing power. He went viral for ripping government ministries such as Culture and Women off a whiteboard while shouting 'afuera!' - 'out!' Among other austerity measures, he halved government ministries, cut tens of thousands of public jobs, slashed budgets including for education, health, pensions and infrastructure, and removed subsidies – spiking utility and transport prices. His initial devaluing of the peso by 50% caused inflation to spike but then it fell as people spent less and demand fell. EPA/Shutterstock Milei's supporters credit him with taming Argentina's previously rampant inflation 'Echoes of Thatcherism' When I met him in April 2024 at his office, there were sculptures of him with a chainsaw on display and coasters showing Margaret Thatcher's face. Thatcher is loathed by many people in Argentina owing to the Falklands War, but Milei told me he admired her and that she was \"brilliant.\" Last month one British newspaper described Milei's own approach as having \"echoes of Thatcherism\". Reuters Javier Milei's reforms have drawn comparisons with those of Margaret Thatcher He believes this will help alleviate poverty in the long-run and enable lower taxes, but also help people to plan their own spending more easily with inflation currently fluctuating less. On 7 September Milei's party lost unexpectedly badly in the Buenos Aires provincial elections. EPA - EFE/REX/Shutterstock Some observers say Milei displays a lack of empathy towards those affected by cuts Financial markets had generally supported his economic programme. But the midterm elections were upcoming and the £15bn of debt repayments are due next year. Trump's £15bn currency swap lifeline has provided some stability: Argentine bonds and the peso rose in value in response to the announcement. But D'Alessandro argues that though US intervention might solve a wider problem, nothing will change in \"people's real lives\". Some of Milei's supporters - like Mr Boggiano - believe there is something else at play in the round criticism of the president: In this view much of it comes down to the opposition trying to \"break\" what Milei has done, in order to get back into power. Meanwhile, Argentina owes $20bn of debt next year. The left-wing governor of Buenos Aires, Axel Kicillof, has been touted as a future presidential candidate, long ahead of the elections in 2027. Still, he believes it is too early to judge: \"We are in the middle of his term… The story hasn't finished.\" Top picture credit: WPA Pool/Getty Images, Bloomberg via Getty Images BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

ERDOĞAN’IN MEZARDA RAKI OLAYINA GİRMESİ ÖZGÜR Özel ’in Kamer Genç’in mezarı başındaki rakı görüntüsü... Cumhurbaşkanı Erdoğan ’ın bu malzemeyi, büyük bir maharetle değerlendireceğini düşünüyordum. Dün ilk kez bu konuya girdi Cumhurbaşkanı Erdoğan. * “ Daha mezar başında nasıl davranacağından habersiz, kabristanda kadeh tokuşturmayı maharet zanneden birisi ” diye nitelendirdi Özgür Özel’i. Ardından da şu sözleri dizdi ardı ardına: “ Kendi müteveffa milletvekiline saygı duymayan, millete saygı duyar mı? Kendi örfünü, adetini bilmeyen, diplomasinin teamüllerini bilir mi? Çıkmışlar bir de bu edepsizliği savunmaya çalışıyorlar. Allah CHP’li vatandaşlarımıza sabır, bunlara da akıl fikir versin.” * Özgür Özel ve CHP yönetiminin mezarlıkta rakı konusundaki taktik ve stratejisi şu: * Konu unutulsun. * Ancak Erdoğan’ın konuya girişinin ardından... CHP’nin bu taktik ve stratejiyi sürdürmesi bayağı bir zorlaşmış durumda.

Şefkatle yaklaşmak, aşırı anlayışlı olmak, “ Yapmamıştır canım ” tavrı sergilemek, “ Belki de saçına başkasından bulaşmıştır ” diye saçmalamak falan... Hunharca yaklaşmak, yargıdan önce hüküm vermek , “ Tabii ki yapmıştır ” demek, onun açıklamalarına kulak tıkamak, istifa çağrıları yapmak falan... Bunların da amacı: Gerçeğe ulaşmak değil. * Yani Sadettin Saran olayı, Sadettin Saran olayı değildir.

AMCASI ACAYİP AK PARTİLİ ÇIKMIŞ UYUŞTURUCU operasyonu nedeniyle tutuklanmış biri için şöyle haber yapıyorlar: * “ Amcası acayip AK Partili çıktı. ” * Bu haberi yapanların amacı AK Parti’yi yıpratmak. * Oysa bu haber, AK Parti’ye artı yazar. Çünkü amcası acayip AK Partili olan kişinin yeğeninin gözünün yaşına bakılmadığını kanıtlar bu olay. BÜYÜK, DAHA BÜYÜK İSİM OPERASYONDA bir isim gözaltına alınıyor.

Bağımlılık benim bin kilometre yakınımdan bile geçmez. Mehmet Akif Ersoy’un da Rumeysa Cebeci’nin de testleri pozitif çıktı. Çok net yalanlamaların etkileme gücü neredeyse sıfırın altına indi.

      "summary_tr_long": "Aralık 25, 2025 06:11 Linkedin Flipboard Linki Kopyala Yazı Tipi KANDA YOKSA SAÇTA NASIL ‘POZİTİF’ ÇIKAR “Bilirkişi raporlarının özelliği budur; aleyhe gelen taraf her zaman itiraz eder. Ama bu, kişinin doğruyu söylediği anlamına da gelmez. Ancak uyuşturucu ya da babalık testi gibi kimya testlerinin sonuçlarının yüzde 99.9 doğru çıkması önemli ve kesin delildir. SIRADAN BİR LABORATUVAR DEĞİL Uyuşturucu soruşturmasında tarafların itiraz ettiği raporlar, İstanbul’daki Adli Tıp Kurumu bünyesinde, Kimya İhtisas Dairesi merkez laboratuvarında hazırlanmıştır. Bu laboratuvar; bilimsel yöntemler ve son teknoloji ile çalışan, doğru çalıştığı başka kurumlarca kabul edilmiş, denetlenen, akredite bir laboratuvardır. VÜCUDUN HAFIZASI SAÇTIR Kişi, eğer bir madde kullanılmışsa, bu 3 güne kadar kanında tespit edilebilir. İdrarda ise kullandıktan sonraki pozitiflik süresi 5-7 gün arasındadır. Tırnak ise narkotik madde çalışmak için itibarlı bir bölge değildir. Tırnak, DNA testinde daha kıymetli bir örnek olmakla beraber, konunun kamuoyunda yaratabileceği etki göz önüne alınarak, tırnaktan da örnek alınmış. Kan, idrar ve tırnakta çıkmamış ama saçta çıkmış olması kafanızı karıştırmasın. Saç hepsinden farklı; vücudun hafızasıdır. Yapısındaki keratinden kaynaklı olarak her maddeyi her santiminde en az 1 ay saklar. Uyuşturucu bir madde yenice kullanıldıysa kalıntısı muhtemelen saçın dibindedir. Saç uzadıkça madde de aşağı, uca doğru iner. uzunlukta bir saçın ucunda madde kalıntısı varsa, o kişi o maddeyi en az 1 yıl önce kullanmış demektir bu. Kalıntı, saç derisinden 3 santim aşağıda bulunduysa o zaman 3 ay önce kullanmış demektir.” SAÇ KESİLİRSE DELİLKAYBOLUR MU “Evet, kaybolur. Zaten çoğu kişi bu noktada saçının kısalığına güvenir. Gözaltına alınmadan evvel saçlarını kısacık kestirip gelen çoktur. Herhangi bir madde çıkmasın diye alınmış bir önlemdir bu. Ki yakında yine böyle bir kısa saç modası görürseniz şaşırmayın. Diyelim numune alınan kişinin saçı 2.5 cm. Adli Tıp, o saçın her milimine, detaylıca bakar. Hangi miliminde, hangi madde olduğu, kişinin kaç hafta evvel o maddeyi kullandığı, o maddenin saçta hangi metotla tespit edildiği gibi tüm detaylar Adli Tıp raporunda yazar ve bu detaylı raporu ancak savcılığın istemesi durumunda açıklar ve yine istenirse raporunun doğruluğu için elindeki “şahit numune” ile yeniden doğrulama da yapabilir.” Sadettin Saran İLAÇ KULLANMAK TEST SONUÇLARINI ETKİLER Mİ “Ela Rümeysa Cebeci de ilk ifadesinde bir estetik ameliyat olduğu ve bundan kaynaklı testinin pozitif çıktığını iddia etmişti. Şöyle diyelim; ağrı kesici, ateş düşürücü ya da uyku ilaçları, herhangi bir ameliyat/operasyon dolayısıyla alınan sedatifler, takviyeler veya saç boyası gibi kimyasallardaki ‘yasal’ maddeler ile ‘yasadışı’ maddelerin kullanımı hem de çok net şekilde ayırt edilebilir. Toksikolojik analizler o kadar duyarlıdır ki eser miktardaki kalıntıları saptar. Yine aynı şekilde kapalı mekânda, dar, havalandırmasız bir ortamda, yoğun duman altında kaldınız diyelim. Maruziyetin pasif mi yoksa aktif kullanım sonucu mu olduğunu bu testlerle net şekilde söylemek mümkündür. Aksi ancak kişilerin kendini savunmak için ortaya attığı iddialardır. TESTLER SADECE 1 KERE Mİ YAPILDI “Hayır. Dolayısıyla teste tabi tutulanın kim olduğundan bağımsız olarak, testlerin doğrulaması, daha ileri metotlarla, birden çok kez yapılır. Nevzat Alkan YENİDEN ÖRNEK VERMEYE GEREK YOK Ayrıca ‘şahit’ numune ayrılır. Saran da dahil ‘yeniden numune alınsın’ diyor sanıklar. Aldığı örneğin bir kısmında çalışır, diğer kısmı da testi ‘doğrulamak’ ya da savcılık ‘testi yeniden yapın’ derse diye ‘şahit’ numune olarak saklar. Ayrıca Adli Tıp numuneleri bir hastanede de pekâlâ aldırabilirdi. Ama riske girmemek, olası bir karışıklığı önlemek adına saç, tırnak, kan ve idrar örneklerini kendi aldı. Bunun da altını çizelim.” ALINAN ÖRNEKLERİN KİME AİT OLDUĞU BİLİNİYOR MU “Uluslararası standartlarda bu iş, ‘körleme’ yapılır. Yani çalışan, kimin numunesini çalıştığını bilmez. Numunenin üzerinde sadece bir kod vardır. Türkiye’de nasıl yapılıyor dersen emin değilim. Sanıyorum, net olmamakla beraber, numuneler isim ile inceleniyor. Doğru bir uygulama değil.” BİR BAŞKA LABORATUVARDA TEST YAPILMASI SONUCU DEĞİŞTİRİR Mİ “Sadettin Saran’ın madde kullandığına dair kabulü var ama itham edilen maddeyi kesinlikle kullanmadığına yönelik net bir itirazı var. Adli Tıp ise net şekilde ‘bulduk’ diyor. Bu noktada kişi/kişiler elbette yeniden test yaptırabilir. Ancak bu yeni test sonucunun delil sayılabilmesi için Adli Tıp Kurumu’na eş bir kurumda yapılması şarttır. Şu an herhangi bir özel hastanede test yaptırabilirsiniz ancak çıkacak ‘negatifliğin’ bir önemi yoktur. Eğer tüm dünyada kabul gören, saygınlığı bulunan, akredite bir üniversite ya da kurumda, ki Almanya’da 33 adet var, İtalya’da da var, testinizi yeniden yaptırır ve buradan ‘negatif’ sonuç alırsanız o zaman işler karışır.”",

Fenerbahçe , Domenico Tedesco’nun çok istediği Anthony Musaba için hızlı bir operasyona imza attı. Yıldız futbolcunun menajeri İstanbul’a geldi, ilk görüşmede anlaşma sağlandı. TRANSFER KRİZ ÇIKARDI Bu transfer Fenerbahçe ile arasında gerginlik bulunan Samsunspor Başkanı Yüksel Yıldırım’ı fazlasıyla kızdırdı. Yüksel Yıldırım önceki günlerde yaptığı açıklamada, \"Fenerbahçe bizimle hiç konuşmadı. Oyuncunun serbest kalma maddesini kullanarak almaya çalıştıklarını biliyorum. Kontratta serbest kalma için belirlenen bir bedel var. O miktarı peşin öderlerse oyuncuyu alabilirler.\" ifadelerini kullandı.

Musaba'nın son haftalardaki tavrı, bende bir hayal kırıklığı yarattı. Farklı kulüpte forma giymeye devam edecek. Musaba son zamanlar bize farklı davranmaya başladı. Kadroya girmek istemediğini ve antrenmanlara çıkmak istemediğini söyledi. Takındığı tavır karşısında hayal kırıklığı yaşadım. Son haftalar performansını bilerek düşük tuttu.\" OLAY HAMLE \"Yapılan terbiyesizlik\" diyen Yüksel Yıldırım ’ın flaş bir hamle yapıp, Galatasaray ile iletişime geçtiği öne sürüldü.

Türkiye’nin dört bir yanından kaçak içki üretenlere yapılan operasyonların haberleri geliyor. Özellikle metil alkol içeren ürünler vücutta kalıcı hasarlar bırakabiliyor ve hatta ölümle sonuçlanabiliyor. Yılbaşı öncesi sahte içki konusunda çok dikkatli olmanız gerektiğini belirten uzmanlar, bilmeniz gereken tüm detayları hürriyet.com.tr’ye anlattı. Yılbaşı yaklaştıkça sahte içkiye yönelik operasyonlar arttı. Jandarma 17 şehirde sahte içki operasyonu gerçekleştirdi. Son iki haftada yapılan operasyonlarda 27 bin 886 litre sahte içki, 67 bin 994 litre etil alkol ele geçirildi, 6 adet yasa dışı alkollü içki imalathanesini deşifre edildi ve 66 şüpheli hakkında adli işlem yapıldı. İzmir'de de yılbaşı öncesi düzenlenen sahte içki operasyonu ve denetiminde gözaltına alınan 22 şüpheliden 3'ü tutuklandı, 19'u hakkında adli işlem yapıldı. Ekipler, ayrıca 22 eğlence mekânında da denetim gerçekleştirdi. Aramalarda 261 litre taklit etiketli etil alkol, 195 şişe sahte içki, gümrük kaçağı 2 bin 382 paket sigara, 350 puro, 128 elektronik sigara cihazı ile 1 ruhsatsız tabanca ve 60 fişek ele geçirildi. Sahte içki ürettiği ve satışını yaptığı iddiasıyla 22 şüpheli gözaltına alındı. -- Sahte içki nasıl ölümcül hale geliyor? -- İçkinin sahte olduğunu anlamanın bir yolu var mı? -- Sahte içki içtiğini fark eden biri ne yapmalı? Bu soruları ve tüm merak edilenleri uzman isimlere sorduk. KİMYA SANAYİNDE KULLANILAN METİL ALKOL İLE ÜRETİLİYOR Sahte içkinin, etil alkol yerine dörtte biri maliyetle elde edilebilen metil alkol kullanılarak üretildiğini ve çeşitli sağlık sorunlarının yanı sıra ölümlere de neden olduğunu söyleyen Prof. Leyla İyilikçi Karaoğlan sahte içkinin tam olarak ne olduğunu şöyle anlattı: “ Tarımsal ürünlerin damıtılmasıyla elde edilen etil alkolün aksine metil alkol; odun, kömür hatta doğalgaz damıtılarak oluşturuluyor ve kimya sanayiinde kullanılıyor. Sağlıksız olduğu gibi yasa dışı da olan bu içkiler, kaçak olarak satılıyor. Sahte içki, bandrollü olanların yaklaşık üçte biri fiyatına satılması nedeniyle tercih ediliyor. Sahte içkilerde, metil alkolün yanı sıra farklı aroma ve boyalar da bulunuyor. Bu yolla bilinen içkilerin tadına yaklaştırılan sahte içkiler, damacana, pet şişe veya atık içki şişelerine konularak satılıyor.” İŞTE SAHTE İÇKİNİN VÜCUDA VERDİĞİ BÜTÜN ZARARLAR Tıbbi Toksikolog Doç. Aynur Şahin , \"Zehirli alkol dediğimiz metil alkol vücutta daha da zehirli olan bir maddeye dönüşür ve kanda ciddi oranda asit artışıyla beraber bilincin kapanmasına kalp ve dolaşımın durması sonucu ölüme sebebiyet verir. Bunun yanında kalıcı beyin ve göz hasarına yol açar \" dedi. Anesteziyoloji ve Reanimasyon Uzmanı Yoğun Bakım Sorumlu Hekimi Dr. Tacettin Özışık , \" Görme, işitme kaybı, organ yetmezliği, böbreklerin kaybı sonrası diyaliz hastası olma durumu ve en son noktada ölüm olarak sıralayabiliriz\" bilgisini verdi. Anesteziyoloji ve Reanimasyon Uzmanı Doç. Şule Özbilgin ise ekledi: \"Hayati zararlar beyni etkileyen santral sinir sisteminden başlar tüm vücudumuzdaki organları da içererek insan vücudunun tamamını etkiler. Bilinç bulanıklığı, denge ve hareket bozukluğu, baş ağrısı, bulantı, kusma, şiddetli karın ağrısı, sırt, kol ve bacaklarda ağrı, görme bozukluğu ve daha sonra körlük, tedavi edilmediği takdirde metabolik asidoz, koma ve solunum durması sonucu ölüm. Alınan metil alkol miktarına bağlı olarak 4-15 mililitre dozda körlük ve 15-100 mililitre dozda ölüm meydana gelebilmektedir.\" Sahte içkinin sağlığa vurabileceği darbeleri şöyle sıralayabiliriz: Santral sinir sistemi: Beyin hasarı, görme kaybı, halüsinasyonlar, demans Solunum sistemi: Akciğer enfeksiyonları Sindirim sistemi: Siroz, karaciğer büyümesi ve yağlanması, pankreatit, ülser, gastrit gibi mide şikayetleri Renal sistem: Böbrek yetmezliği Endokrin sistem: Kontrolü zor olan diyabet Kardiyovasküler sistem: Kalp büyümesi, kalp yetmezliği, hipertansiyon, aritmi Diğer: Ellerde titreme, uyuşukluk, vücutta kas erimesi, erkekte impotans, kadında infertilite problemleri ve cinsel yolla geçen bulaşıcı hastalıklarda artış İÇKİNİN SAHTE OLDUĞUNU ANLAMANIN BİR YOLU VAR MI? Şule Özbilgin bu soruyu şöyle yanıtladı: “ Sahte içkiler ne kokusundan ne de tadından anlaşılıyor. Uzmanlar açık gelen şişelerden şüphelenilmesi gerektiğinin altını çiziyor. İçki şişelerindeki barkod ve etiketler de önemli ipuçları veriyor. Orijinal ürün takip sistemi kurulmalıdır. Son yapılan girişimlerle ülkemizde 'Tütün ve Alkollü İçki Mamullerinde Ürün İzleme Sistemi (ÜİS)' sistemi ile satış yerlerine yerleştirilen sorgulama kodu sayesinde alkollü içecekler hakkında her türlü bilgiye ulaşılabilir.” Erken hastaneye başvuru, doğru tanı ve hızlı tedavi ile hastaların hayatta kalma şansı yükselirken geç başvuru ve tıbbi müdahalenin geç olması hastalarda çok yüksek ölüm oranına sebep olur. Aynur Şahin SAHTE İÇKİ İÇTİĞİNİZİ FARK EDERSENİZ HEMEN BUNLARI YAPIN “En yakın hastaneye başvurup durumu bildirmesi gerekmektedir. Bu aslında bir çeşit zehirlenme vakasıdır ve biz bunu 'alkolle zehirlenme' olarak adlandırıyoruz” diyen Leyla İyilikçi Karaoğlan ekledi: “Zehir Danışma Merkezleri ile ve yoğun bakım hekimleri ile konsülte ederek bu hastanın sistematik olarak muayene edilmesi, kan alkol düzeyi, laboratuvar sonuçları, kan gazı sonuçları gibi tüm incelemelerinin ayrıntılı olarak yapılması gerekmektedir.”",

      "summary_tr_long": "Oluşturulma Tarihi: Aralık 23, 2025 12:55 Yumurtaya alerjisi olan üniversite öğrencisi Remziye Horuz, doğum gününde yediği pastanın ardından fenalaştı ve tedavi gördüğü hastanede hayatını kaybetti. Peki, yumurta alerjisi bu kadar tehlikeli olabilir mi? Ve yalnızca yumurta değil, herhangi bir maddeye alerjisi olanlar için alerjik reaksiyonlar ne kadar ölümcül risk taşır? Ağrı’da yumurtaya alerjisi olan ve doğum gününde arkadaşlarının aldığı pastayı yedikten sonra rahatsızlanan üniversite öğrencisi Remziye Horuz , 2 Aralık’tan bu yana tedavi gördüğü hastanede yaşamını yitirdi. Anadolu Ajansı’nda yer alan haberde iddiaya göre, şehir merkezinde bir pastaneye giden iki öğrenci, arkadaşlarının yumurtaya alerjisinin olduğunu belirterek, yumurta içermeyen pasta siparişi verdi. Aldıkları pastayla arkadaşlarının doğum gününü kutlayan öğrenciler, pastayı tükettikten sonra genç kadının fenalaştığını fark etti. Ağrı Eğitim ve Araştırma Hastanesine kaldırılan üniversite öğrencisi, aynı gece yoğun bakıma alındı. Tüm yapılan müdahalelere rağmen de yoğun bakımdaki yaşam mücadelesini kaybetti. ÜÇ ZANLI TUTUKLANDI Ağrı Cumhuriyet Başsavcılığınca yürütülen soruşturma kapsamında, pastanede çalışan Y.A., F.Y. Emniyetteki işlemlerin ardından adliyeye sevk edilen üç zanlı, çıkarıldıkları hakimlikçe tutuklandı. Öte yandan, olay günü alınan pasta numunesinin yumurta bileşeni içerip içermediğinin tespiti için İstanbul İl Tarım Müdürlüğü Laboratuvarına teslim edildiği öğrenildi. Şu ana kadar pastada yumurta bulunup bulunmadığına dair herhangi bir net açıklama yapılmadı. Ancak yumurta içerdiği varsayılırsa, yumurta alerjisi olan bir kişi için bu durum ölümcül olabilir mi? Daha da önemlisi, yalnızca yumurta değil, herhangi bir maddeye alerjisi olan bireyler için alerjik reaksiyonlar hayati risk taşır mı? Konuyu Çocuk İmmünoloji ve Alerji Hastalıkları Uzmanı Prof. Hikmet Tekin Nacaroğlu ile mercek altına aldık. Ağrı İbrahim Çeçen Üniversitesi Rektörü Prof. İlhami Gülçin, başsağlığı mesajı yayımladı. Gülçin, mesajında “Üniversitemiz Mütercim Tercümanlık Bölümü 4. sınıf öğrencisi Remziye Horuz’un geçirdiği gıda alerjik reaksiyonu sonucu tedavi gördüğü yoğun bakımda hayatını kaybettiğini derin bir üzüntüyle öğrenmiş bulunuyoruz. Merhumeye Allah’tan rahmet, ailesine, yakınlarına, arkadaşlarına ve üniversitemiz camiasına başsağlığı diliyorum. Mekânı cennet olsun” ifadelerini kullandı. ‘ALERJİ, ASLINDA BAĞIŞIKLIK SİSTEMİMİZİN ‘YANLIŞ ALARM’ VERMESİDİR’ Çocuk İmmünoloji ve Alerji Hastalıkları Uzmanı Prof. Hikmet Tekin Nacaroğlu öncelikle alerjilerin nasıl ortaya çıktığını anlattı. Uzman isim, alerjilerin bağışıklık sisteminin zararsız maddeleri tehlikeli bir düşman gibi algılaması sonucu ortaya çıktığını belirtti. Normalde bağışıklık sistemi bakteri, virüs ve parazit gibi gerçek tehditlere karşı savaşırken, bazı kişilerde yumurta, süt, fıstık, polen veya ev tozu gibi maddelere karşı aşırı tepki verdiğini söyledi. Nacaroğlu, alerjilerin gelişiminde üç temel faktörün rol oynadığını aktardı: Genetik yatkınlık: Ailede alerji , astım veya egzama öyküsünün bulunması. Bağırsak florası: Mikrobiyota dengesizlikleri; sezaryen doğum, antibiyotik kullanımı veya işlenmiş gıda tüketimi gibi etkenlerle bağırsaktaki faydalı bakterilerin azalması. Çevresel faktörler: Şehirleşme, hijyen standartlarındaki değişimler ve beslenme alışkanlıkları. Nacaroğlu, “Alerji, aslında bağışıklık sistemimizin ‘yanlış alarm’ vermesidir. Bu nedenle risk faktörlerini bilmek ve önlem almak büyük önem taşıyor” dedi. Hikmet Tekin Nacaroğlu, gıda alerjilerinin sadece hafif döküntü, kaşıntı veya karın ağrısı ile sınırlı kalmayabileceğini, bazı durumlarda ise hayatı tehdit eden anafilaksiye yol açabileceğini söyledi. Nacaroğlu, “Anafilaksi, vücudun alerjene karşı aşırı ve hızlı tepki vermesiyle ortaya çıkar. Bu durumda dudak ve yüzde şişlik, kaşıntı, boğazda şişme, bulantı, kusma, karın ağrısı, öksürük, hırıltılı solunum, nefes almada güçlük, kan basıncında düşme ve kalp durması gibi ciddi belirtiler görülebilir” dedi. Uzman, bu nedenle anafilaksinin acil bir tıbbi durum olduğunu vurgulayarak , “Hızlı müdahale edilmezse ölümle sonuçlanabilir” uyarısında bulundu. YUMURTAYA KARŞI ALERJİNİN OLDUKÇA YAYGIN OLDUĞU BİLİNİYOR. YUMURTANIN İÇİNDE ALERJİYE NEDEN OLAN ÖZEL BİR MADDE Mİ VAR? Hikmet Tekin Nacaroğlu, yumurtanın özellikle çocuklarda sık görülen bir alerjen olduğunu belirtti. Uzman isim, bunun nedeninin yumurtadaki bağışıklık sistemi tarafından kolay tanınabilen güçlü proteinler olduğunu söyledi. Nacaroğlu, “Yumurtadaki en önemli alerjenler, özellikle beyazında bulunan ovomukuoid ve ovoalbumin proteinleridir. Bu proteinler ısıya dayanıklı olabilir ve pişirilmiş gıdalarda bile alerjik reaksiyona yol açabilir” uyarısında bulundu ve şöyle devam etti: “Çocukların büyük bir kısmında yumurta alerjisi yaşla birlikte kaybolur. Özellikle okul çağına doğru tolerans gelişebilir. Ancak bu süreç her çocuğun alerjik yükü değişken olduğu için aynı düzeyde ilerlemez. Bu nedenle, alerji geçene kadar tam kaçınma ve dikkat şarttır.” YUMURTA DIŞINDA EN SIK ALERJİ YAPAN GIDALAR HANGİLERİDİR? Dünyada ve Türkiye’de en sık sorumlu olan gıdalara değinen Prof. Hikmet Tekin Nacaroğlu, “Çocuklarda: İnek sütü, yumurta, buğday, yer fıstığı, ağaç yemişleri (fındık, ceviz, kaju) ve susam. Ergen ve Erişkinlerde: Yer fıstığı, ağaç yemişleri ve deniz ürünleri (karides, midye vb.).” ifadelerini kullandı. “Fındık, yer fıstığı ve deniz ürünleri, özellikle ölümcül reaksiyon riski yüksek olan alerjenlerdir” diyen Prof. Nacaroğlu, “Çoklu gıda alerjisi olanlar, astımı bulunanlar ve daha önce şiddetli reaksiyon geçiren hastalarda anafilaktik şok için daha yüksek risk altındadır” dedi. ALERJİ ÖMÜR BOYU SÜRER Mİ, TEDAVİ EDİLEBİLİR Mİ? Bu soruma “Bu durum alerjinin türüne ve kişiye göre değişir” cevabını veren Prof. Hikmet Tekin Nacaroğlu, şu önemli bilgilerin altını çizdi: -- Çocukluk çağı alerjileri : Süt, yumurta ve buğday alerjileri çoğu çocukta zamanla geçebilir. Kalıcı olabilen alerjiler: Yer fıstığı, ağaç yemişleri ve deniz ürünlerine karşı gelişen alerjiler daha uzun sürebilir, hatta ömür boyu devam edebilir. -- Bu yüzde anafilaksi yani alerjik şok seviyesinde besin alerjisi olan bireylerin mutlaka anafilaksi durumda ne yapmaları gerektiğini belirten yazılı bir acil eylem planına sahip olmaları, adrenalin iğnesi (adrenalin oto enjektörleri) taşımaları ve kullanım bilgisine sahip olmaları gerekir. Adrenalin oto enjektörleri, anafilaksi gibi ciddi alerjik reaksiyonlara yönelik acil müdahalede kullanılan hayati öneme sahip araçlardır. Bu yüzden tüm restaurant ve tesislerde, özellikle alerjen maruziyeti riskinin fazla olduğu açık büfe kullanım alanlarında adrenalin oto enjektörleri bulundurulmalıdır.",
