      "summary_tr_long": "US launches strikes against Islamic State in Nigeria Jaroslav Lukiv and Sean Seddon US Department of Defense The US defence department posted a short video that appears to show a missile being launched from a military vessel The US has launched strikes against militants linked to the Islamic State group (IS) in north-western Nigeria, where militants have sought to establish a foothold. Camps run by the group in Sokoto state, which lies on Nigeria's border with Niger, were hit, the US military said, adding that an \"initial assessment\" suggested \"multiple\" fatalities. US President Donald Trump said the Christmas Day strikes were \"powerful and deadly\" and labelled the group \"terrorist scum\", saying it had been \"targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians\". Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar told the BBC it was a \"joint operation\" and had \"nothing to do with a particular religion\". Tuggar said the strikes had been planned \"for quite some time\" and had used intelligence information provided by Nigeria. Referencing the timing of the strikes, he said they did not have \"anything to do with Christmas, it could be any other day - it is to do with attacking terrorists who have been killing Nigerians\". The Nigerian government has for several years been fighting a complex network of jihadist groups, which includes Boko Haram and IS-linked splinter groups, but largely in the north-east of the country, hundreds of miles away from Sokoto state. Eyewitness Umar Jabo told BBC News that the attack took place late on Thursday night near the village of Jabo: \"Everyone thought it was a plane. It crashed in fields.\" His comment was backed up by images posted on social media that showed local people standing in a field filming the burning aftermath of the attack. Umar Jabo denied any IS fighters had been killed: \"Here in Jabo, we live peacefully, and there is no conflict between us and Christians.\" The Trump administration has previously accused the Nigerian government of failing to protect Christians from jihadist attacks and has claimed a \"genocide\" is being perpetrated. Trump has labelled Nigeria a \"country of particular concern\", a designation used by the US state department that provides for sanctions against countries \"engaged in severe violations of religious freedom\". The US military was ordered to prepare to intervene in Nigeria in November . At the time, an adviser to Nigerian President Bola Tinubu told BBC News that militants had targeted people \"across faiths\", and said any US military action should be carried out jointly. Groups monitoring violence say there is no evidence to suggest that Christians are being killed more than Muslims in Nigeria, which is divided roughly evenly between followers of the two religions. In a social media post late on Christmas Day confirming the strikes, Trump said that he would \"not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper\". US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Thursday that he was \"grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation\". The US Department of Defense later posted a short video that appeared to show a missile being launched from a ship. Militants allied to IS have sought to establish a presence in two north-western states, while a separate IS-linked group has a stronghold in north-eastern Borno On Friday morning, the Nigerian foreign ministry said in a statement that the country's authorities \"remain engaged in structured security co-operation with international partners, including the United States of America, in addressing the persistent threat of terrorist and violent extremism\". Jihadist groups such as Boko Haram and IS-linked offshoots have wrought havoc in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade, killing thousands of people. Nigerian human rights lawyer and conflict analyst Bulama Bukati speculated that Thursday's strikes had targeted a relatively new IS-aligned splinter group, which originated in the Sahel region and has recently moved its fighters to Nigeria. The largest IS-linked group in Nigeria - Islamic State West Africa Province - operates in the north-east of the country, he told BBC World Service, while the smaller group - known locally as Lakurawa - has sought to establish a base in north-western Sokoto state. He continued: \"They started slipping into Nigeria in 2018 but over the past 18 months or two years they established camps in Sokoto state and Kebbi state. \"They have been launching attacks and imposing their social laws over people in Sokoto state over the past 18 months or so.\" Local lawmaker Bashar Isah Jabo was adamant that the village had no IS or Lakurawa members at all, and he said the area where the missile fell was less than 500m (1,600ft) from a local hospital. According to BBC Monitoring, a pro-IS social media channel has been reporting on almost daily US reconnaissance flights in Sokoto, as well as in the north-eastern state of Borno, where the Nigeria's largest IS-linked group has its stronghold. In central Nigeria, there are also frequent clashes between mostly Muslim herders and farming groups, who are often Christian, over access to water and pasture. Deadly cycles of tit-for-tat attacks have also seen thousands killed - but atrocities have been committed on both sides. The Nigeria strikes are the second major US intervention targeting IS in recent weeks. Last week, the US said it had carried out a \"massive strike\" against IS in Syria . US Central Command (Centcom) said fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery \"struck more than 70 targets at multiple locations across central Syria\". Those strikes were launched in retaliation for the killing of three Americans - two soldiers and a civilian interpreter - in an ambush launched by the group.",

      "summary_tr": "Earlier this week Zelensky gave details of an updated 20-point peace plan , agreed by US and Ukrainian envoys in Florida. The 20-point peace plan agreed by the US and Ukraine is seen as an update to the initial draft prepared by Witkoff several weeks ago. Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk.",
      "summary_tr_long": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has given a positive assessment of a conversation he had with US envoys on how to end the Russia-Ukraine war. Zelensky said Thursday's call with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, which lasted nearly an hour, had yielded \"new ideas in terms of formats, meetings, and... timing on how to bring a real peace closer\". He added later that he would hold another meeting with President Donald Trump \"in the near future\". Earlier this week Zelensky gave details of an updated 20-point peace plan , agreed by US and Ukrainian envoys in Florida. The Kremlin said it was analysing proposals brought back from the US by a Russian envoy. Trump and his envoys have been holding talks with both Ukraine and Russia in an effort to reach a deal to end the war which was started by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. There appears to have been some progress in recent days with Ukraine's president praising the \"good ideas\" put forward by Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Kushner. Zelensky said it had been an \"active day\" for his country's diplomacy, as he went into details with the US envoys. He conceded that there was still \"work to be done on sensitive issues\" but added that \"together with the American team, we understand how to put all of this in place\". Zelensky added that Ukraine's top negotiator Rustem Umerov, the country's top security official, \"will continue discussions with the American team\". The 20-point peace plan agreed by the US and Ukraine is seen as an update to the initial draft prepared by Witkoff several weeks ago. That draft was widely seen as heavily geared towards Russia's maximalist pre-invasion demands, which Kyiv and its European allies said would mean the de facto capitulation of Ukraine. Describing the updated proposal on Wednesday, Zelensky had said it offered Russia the potential withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the east and the creation of a demilitarised zone in their place. He said the plan now included security guarantees from the US, Nato and Europeans for a co-ordinated military response if Russia invaded Ukraine again. On the key question of Ukraine's industrial eastern Donetsk region, Zelensky said a \"free economic zone\" was a potential option. Any area that Ukrainian troops pulled out of would have to be policed by Ukraine, he stressed. Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. Zelensky has been under heavy pressure from Trump to cede all of Donbas to Russia during ongoing Washington-led peace negotiations. The Ukrainian leader has so far rejected any territorial concessions, and instead demanded iron-clad security guarantees for Ukraine in any potential settlement. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned that Ukrainian troops must leave Donbas or Russia will seize it . On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was studying the proposals brought back from the US by the Russian envoy, Kirill Dmitriev. \"We are examining this material, and depending on the decisions made by the head of state, we will continue our communication with the Americans,\" he said. While diplomatic efforts to end the conflict inch forward, fighting continues on the ground. The Ukrainian military said on Thursday that it had struck one of Russia's key oil refineries in the southern region of Rostov with cruise missiles. The Novoshakhtinsk refinery near the Ukrainian border is critical for supplying fuel for Russian military operations in occupied eastern Ukraine. The Russian defence ministry said its forces had taken control of the settlement of Sviato-Pokrovske in the Donetsk region. Earlier this week, Ukrainian troops withdrew from the embattled eastern town of Siversk . The capture of the town brings Russia closer to the last remaining \"fortress belt\" cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk still in Ukrainian hands in the Donetsk region.",

The Thai Air Force said it had hit a Cambodian \"fortified military position\" after civilians had left the area. Cambodia's defence ministry accused Thailand of \"indiscriminate attacks\" against civilian houses and injuring several people. Fighting broke out again earlier this month after a fragile ceasefire in July halted five days of intense border clashes. At least 41 people have been killed and almost one million displaced since the hostilities resumed. Both countries have blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce. Since then, fighting has spread to nearly every province along the 500-mile (800km) border. Cambodia's defence ministry said Friday's attacks were in the north-western Banteay Meanchey province. Up to 40 bombs were dropped by F-16 fighter jets, the ministry said in a Facebook post. Thailand said the action was aimed at controlling Nong Chan village, and was \"carried out efficiently and successfully\". It came as Thai and Cambodian negotiators held their third day of talks at a border checkpoint. Defence ministers from both sides are due to join the discussions on Saturday. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Friday that once both sides agreed to each other's conditions, a ceasefire agreement could be signed. \"I hope this time will be the last one we'd have to sign, so that peace can occur in the area,\" he said, \"[and] people can return to their homes.\" The US and China have also been attempting to mediate a new ceasefire. The dispute between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, and there have been sporadic clashes, with soldiers and civilians killed on both sides over the years. But in May, tensions ramped up after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash.

      "summary_tr_long": "Indonesians raise white flags as anger grows over slow flood aid Kelly Ng, Singapore, Riana Ibrahim, BBC Indonesian, Jakarta and Raja Eben Lumbanrau, BBC Indonesian, Jakarta AFP via Getty Images People in Indonesia's Aceh province are raising white flags as a call for international solidarity For weeks now, angry and distressed residents in Indonesia's westernmost province have been raising white flags over the state's slow response to a series of deadly floods. Triggered by a rare cyclone in November , the deluge killed more than 1,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands across the island of Sumatra. In Aceh, the worst-hit province which accounted for nearly half of the deaths, many still do not have ready access to clean water, food, electricity and medical supplies. In a sign of just how frustrating managing the crisis has become, the governor of North Aceh broke down publicly earlier this month. But President Prabowo Subianto has refused foreign aid, insisting the situation is \"under control\". Prabowo has also ignored calls to declare it a national disaster, which would unlock emergency funds and streamline relief efforts. Prabowo's administration has increasingly been criticised as reactive, disorganised and out of touch – adjectives that some analysts say have come to define his presidency, which he won in February 2024 on the back of populist pledges. Already this year, his flagship billion-dollar free school meals programme has been mired in controversy over mass food poisonings . In August and September, thousands of Indonesians took to the streets over unemployment and rising costs of living, in what were some of the biggest protests the country has seen in decades. And now his government's response to November's floods has become yet another challenge for the leader, even as his approval ratings have held steady at about 78%. AFP via Getty Images Many in Aceh still do not have ready access to clean water, food and electricity Desperate calls for help Last Thursday, dozens of protesters rallied in Aceh's capital, Banda Aceh, waving white flags and demanding that the central government opens the door to foreign aid. Standing among the crowd was a little girl holding a sheet of paper, which read: \"I am just three years old, I want to grow up in a safe and sustainable world.\" Though typically seen as a symbol for surrender, the white flags that have popped up across the province – on broken rooftops, along eroded riverbanks and outside mosques – are a call for international solidarity, protesters say. They are a distress signal to grab the attention of friends outside, to let them know the conditions in Aceh today are very bad,\" Husnul Khawatinnissa, who was at the rally, told the BBC. Entire villages have been wiped out, while widespread damage to roads and infrastructure has also isolated many communities. \"How long more do we have to wash ourselves in mud and floodwaters,\" shouted Nurmi Ali, another demonstrator. Provincial authorities have reached out to the United Nations for support, with the Aceh governor declaring that he welcomes help \"from anyone, anywhere\". Prabowo's administration has said relief efforts are under way on a \"national scale\", noting that it has disbursed some 60 trillion rupiah ($3.6bn) for reconstruction efforts. Disaster strikes again For some in Aceh, the situation brings back painful memories of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, one of the worst natural disasters ever. A magnitude 9.1 undersea earthquake unleashed a tsunami that triggered waves up to 30m (100 feet) high which slammed into the Indian Ocean coastline that morning, killing an estimated 230,000 people in more than a dozen countries. Locals say they had only recently finished rebuilding their lives when disaster struck again in November. Relief arrived more quickly after the 2004 tsunami, even though it was far more devastating, they say. Various countries, multilateral agencies like the World Bank, and private organisations poured billions of dollars into the recovery effort. What we're suffering now is worse,\" said Rindu Majalina, who was a high-school student when the tsunami struck. The mother of three has been struggling to feed her children since the recent floods swallowed their home. Residents \"fight like zombies\" for every bit of supply delivered to her village \"because we are starving\", she added. The UAE, for instance, sent 30 tonnes of rice and 300 relief packages to Medan, another city hit by the floods - but it was all sent back by authorities following what they described as \"guidance\" from the central government. Getty Images Prabowo Subianto (centre) and his administration have increasingly been criticised as out of touch The president's refusal to accept international aid is his way of asserting authority, said Vidhyandika Djati Perkasa, a senior politics researcher at Indonesia's Centre for Strategic and International Studies. [Prabowo] doesn't want to be seen as a failure and is trying to maintain his image ,\" Mr Perkasa said, noting however that this could backfire politically. Prabowo has prioritised the \"symbolic performance of sovereignty\" over crisis management, said Vedi Hadiz, an Asian studies professor at the University of Melbourne. Some also accuse Prabowo of being insensitive toward flood victims by promoting the expansion of palm oil plantations - environmental groups say the deforestation caused by that has also worsened the floods. Rindu Majalina said she initially thought herself fortunate to have survived the floods, \"but it turns out the post-disaster situation is even worse\". My children don't know if they'll ever be able to go back to school.\" With reporting by Akramul Muslim, Rino Abonita and Nanda Fahriza Batubara in Aceh",

      "summary_tr_long": "Pope Leo has urged Ukraine and Russia to find the \"courage\" to hold direct talks to end the war during his first Christmas remarks to crowds in St Peter's square. He called for an end to conflicts around the world during his Urbi et Orbi address, which is traditionally delivered by the pontiff on Christmas Day to worshippers gathered in Vatican City. Speaking about Ukraine, the Pope said: \"May the clamour of weapons cease, and may the parties involved, with the support and commitment of the international community, find the courage to engage in sincere, direct and respectful dialogue.\" His plea comes as US-led negotiations on a deal to end the fighting continues. The US has sought to put together an agreement acceptable to both sides, but direct talks between Russian and Ukraine have not taken place during this latest round of diplomatic efforts. Pope Leo also decried turmoil and conflict plaguing other parts of the world, including Thailand and Cambodia where deadly border clashes have flared up despite a ceasefire in July. He asked that the South East Asian nations' \"ancient friendship\" be restored and \"to work towards reconciliation and peace\". During an earlier Christmas Day sermon in St Peter's Basilica, Pope Leo lamented conditions for homeless people the world over, and the damage caused by conflicts. \"Fragile is the flesh of defenceless populations, tried by so many wars, ongoing or concluded, leaving behind rubble and open wounds,\" he said. He said the story of the birth of Jesus showed that God had \"pitched his fragile tent\" among the people of the world. \"How, then,\" he asked, turning his attention to the conditions of Palestinians, \"can we not think of the tents in Gaza, exposed for weeks to rain, wind and cold?\" Gaza has been devastated by Israeli bombardment in a two-year war, triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. Winter storms have compounded the plight of the territory's 2.1m population, nearly all of whom have been displaced and their homes damaged or destroyed. Aid agencies have called for Israel to allow more tents and urgently needed supplies into Gaza. Cogat, the Israeli military body which controls Gaza's border crossings, has dismissed claims of deliberate aid restrictions, saying almost 310,000 tents and tarpaulins had been delivered since the start of the ceasefire in October.",

      "summary_tr_long": "A US judge has temporarily blocked the detention of British social media campaigner Imran Ahmed, who took legal action against the US government over having his visa removed. The Center for Countering Digital Hate founder was among five people denied US visas after the Trump administration accused them of seeking to \"coerce\" tech platforms into censoring free speech. The move brought a backlash from European leaders defending the work of organisations monitoring online content. Mr Ahmed, a US permanent resident, had warned that being detained and possibly deported would tear him away from his American wife and child. Praising the judge's decision, he told BBC News he would not be \"bullied\". Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said online that the individuals were blocked over concerns that they had organised efforts to pressure US platforms to censor and \" punish American viewpoints they oppose \". Mr Ahmed filed a legal complaint on Wednesday against officials including Rubio and US Attorney General Pamela Bondi over the decision to have him sanctioned. In court documents seen by the BBC, US District Judge Vernon S Broderick said on Thursday he had granted Mr Ahmed's request for a temporary restraining order. The judge also temporarily blocked the officials from detaining Mr Ahmed without the chance for his case to be heard. The BBC has contacted the state department and White House for comment. When approached by AFP news agency, a state department spokesperson was quoted as saying: \"The Supreme Court and Congress have repeatedly made clear: the United States is under no obligation to allow foreign aliens to come to our country or reside here.\" Mr Ahmed said: \"I will not be bullied away from my life's work of fighting to keep children safe from social media's harm and stopping antisemitism online.\" His lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, said the speed of the judge's decision was telling. \"The federal government can't deport a green card holder like Imran Ahmed, with a wife and young child who are American, simply because it doesn't like what he has to say,\" she said. In 2023, Mr Ahmed's centre was sued by Elon Musk's social media company after it reported on a rise in hate speech on the platform since the billionaire's takeover of the firm, now called X.

The former president made his decision known in handwritten letter that was read out by Flávio Bolsonaro outside the hospital were his father is being treated. \"During my life, I have fought tough battles, paying a high price with both my health and my family, to defend what I think is best for our country,\" Bolsonaro wrote. \"I hand over what is most important in the life of a father - my own son for the mission of rescuing our country, Brazil.\" Flávio Bolsonaro, a 44-year-old senator, had already announced his decision to run for president for his father's Liberal Party. Ealier this month, he said his father had entrusted him \"with the mission of continuing our national project\". But Jair Bolsonaro's letter, which has been published by Brazilian media, is confirmation the senator has his father's backing. The incumbent, President Lula, has already announced he plans to run again in the presidential election scheduled for October 2026. In 2022, the presidential election went into a run-off, which saw the older Bolsonaro take on ex-President Lula. When Lula narrowly won, Jair Bolsonaro refused to accept the result and plotted with top military leaders to prevent Lula from taking up office. While the plot failed to enlist enough support from the military to go ahead, it did culminate in the storming of government buildings by Bolsonaro's supporters on 8 January 2023. Bolsonaro was found guilty of coup-plotting and sentenced in September this year. Despite the guilty verdict, the older Bolsonaro still wields considerable political influence. Brazil's Congress passed a bill last week to significantly shorten Bolsonaro's sentence but President Lula said he would veto it. Jair Bolsonaro is expected to be transferred back to federal police headquarters as soon as doctors give the go-ahead.",

He had been the subject of various criminal investigations launched while her Awami League party was in power but was cleared of all charges when her regime fell. Hasina is living in exile in India and her party is unlikely to be permitted to take part in the elections, which many view as among the most consequential in Bangladesh's history. Last month, Hasina was sentenced to death for her role in suppressing anti-government protests . According to UN investigators, up to 1,400 people died in the student-led unrest.

      "summary_tr_long": "Algeria's parliament has unanimously passed a law declaring France's colonisation of the North African state a crime, and demanding an apology and reparations. The law also criminalises the glorification of colonialism, state-run TV reports. The vote is the latest sign of increasingly strained diplomatic relations between the two countries, with some observers saying they are at their lowest since Algeria gained independence 63 years ago. France's colonisation of Algeria between 1830 and 1962 was marked by mass killings, large-scale deportations and ended in a bloody war of independence. Algeria says the war killed 1.5 million people, while French historians put the death toll much lower. France's President Emmanuel Macron has previously acknowledged the colonisation of Algeria was a \"crime against humanity\" but has not offered an apology. Lawmakers wore scarves in the colours of the national flag and chanted \"long live Algeria\" as they applauded the bill's passage through parliament, AFP news agency reports. It says the legislation states that France has \"legal responsibility\" for the \"tragedies it caused\", and \"full and fair\" compensation was an \"inalienable right of the Algerian state and people\". France has not yet commented on the vote. It comes at a time of growing pressure on Western powers to offer reparations for slavery and colonialism, and to return looted artefacts still kept in their museums. Algerian lawmakers have been demanding that France return a 16th Century bronze canon, known as Baba Merzoug, meaning \"Blessed Father\", that was regarded as the protector of Algiers, now Algeria's capital. French forces captured the city in 1830, on their third attempt, and removed the cannon - which is now in the port city of Brest in north-western France. In 2020, France returned the remains of 24 Algerian fighters who were killed resisting French colonial forces in the 19th Century. Last month, Algeria hosted a conference of African states to push for justice and reparations. Algeria's Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf said that a legal framework would ensure that restitution was neither regarded as \"a gift nor a favour\". Diplomatic relations between between Algeria and France soured last year, when Macron announced France was recognising Moroccan sovereignty of Western Sahara and backed a plan for limited autonomy for the disputed territory. Algeria backs the pro-independence Polisario Front in Western Sahara and is seen as its main ally. French-Algerian novelist Boualem Sansal was then arrested at Algiers airport in and jailed for five years, before being pardoned by Algeria's President Abdelmadjid Tebboune last month. Prosecutors said he had undermined national security for making remarks that questioned Algeria's borders.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has asked an appeals court to release him from prison and overturn his conviction on two prostitution-related crimes. In a court filing for an expedited appeal, the rap mogul's attorney argued that he was improperly sentenced, and that the conduct that resulted in his conviction was not criminal in nature. Attorney Alexandra Shapiro called Combs' 50-month prison sentence \"unlawful, unconstitutional, and a perversion of justice\". She asked an appeals court to order that Combs be resentenced, should the panel choose not to throw out his conviction in its entirety. The request is the latest attempt by his team to reduce his sentence or throw out his conviction. The Southern District of New York, which prosecuted Combs, declined to comment on the request to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Combs' lawyers had previously said they would appeal his sentence and conviction. Federal prosecutors in New York accused Combs of using his money, power, and the threat of violence to coerce women into unwanted sexual encounters. During a high-profile trial this spring, the jury heard from two of Combs' ex-girlfriends, Cassie Ventura and a woman who testified as \"Jane Doe\". They said Combs abused them and forced them to participate in so-called \"freak-offs\" with male escorts. The jury found Combs not guilty of the two most serious charges: racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. They convicted him of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. In September, after his conviction, Combs asked Judge Arun Subramanian to consider an acquittal or new trial, citing objections over the way an anti-prostitution statute known as the Mann Act was used to prosecute Combs. Ahead of his sentencing, Combs' attorneys argued he should receive a brief sentence that would essentially amount to time served, a request that would have paved the way for a swift release. Prosecutors, however, asked the judge to send Combs to prison for at least 11 years. US District Judge Arun Subramanian ultimately sentenced Combs to more than four years in prison. He said he considered Combs' contributions to society and testimonials from family and friends, but \"a history of good works can't wash away your record\". Combs' appeal argues that Judge Subramanian did not properly follow sentencing guidelines when sending him to 50-months in prison. It argues the judge \"flouted\" new guidelines and improperly considered conduct for which Combs had been acquitted when formulating his punishment. The filing argues the judge \"acted as a thirteenth juror\" in the case and calls the sentence \"draconian\". Before Judge Subramanian issued his sentence, Combs apologized to Ms Ventura and \"Jane.\" \"My actions were disgusting, shameful, and sick,\" Combs said. \"I got lost in excess, I got lost in my ego.\" Combs is also facing dozens of pending civil lawsuits, which accuse him of sexual assault, rape and sexual exploitation. Many of the lawsuits allege that the rapper used his fame and power to silence accusers through threats. Some detail allegations that the rapper - or those who worked for him - drugged people at parties before alleged assaults. Representatives for Mr Combs have repeatedly said he \"never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor\".",

      "summary_tr_long": "US authorities have discovered more than a million more documents potentially related to the late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein that they plan to release in the coming days and weeks, officials say. The FBI and federal prosecutors in New York informed the Department of Justice (DoJ) of the discovery. \"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible,\" the DoJ said on Wednesday. The department said it could take \"a few more weeks\" before all the files are released. The DoJ has been under scrutiny after not releasing all Epstein files by 19 December, the deadline mandated under a new law. The agency said it would \"continue to fully comply with federal law and President Trump's direction to release the files\". The statement did not specify how the FBI and the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York came across the additional material. Epstein had been facing charges of sex trafficking minors in the state when he died awaiting trial in a New York prison. The news comes after the justice department released thousands of documents - some heavily redacted - related to their investigations into Epstein. The department has been releasing the documents in batches and top officials have said hundreds of thousands of documents still are to be released. The files were released after Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act - signed into law by US President Donald Trump - that ordered the agency to share all the documents with the public while protecting victims' identities. Many of the released documents, which include videos, photos, emails and investigative documents, have heavy redactions, including names of people the FBI appears to cite as possible co-conspirators in the Epstein case. The justice department has faced criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle over the amount of redactions, which the law permits only to protect victims' identities and active criminal investigations. In a post on X after the discovery of the additional documents was announced, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, a congressional panel that has been investigating the Epstein saga, accused the White House of “illegally” withholding the files. “Every day we see lies, incompetence, missed deadlines, and illegal redactions,” Representative Robert Garcia said in a statement. The law passed by Congress and signed last month by Trump states that names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted. It specifically asks the DoJ for internal communications and memos detailing who was investigated and decisions on whether \"to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates\". Included in the documents are emails appearing to be exchanged between FBI personnel in 2019 that mention 10 possible \"co-conspirators\" of Epstein . The emails said six of the group had been served with subpoenas. This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut. Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the justice department. Previous releases of Epstein documents have included revelations that reverberated across the Atlantic. Peter Mandelson was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US after details emerged about his friendship with the convicted paedophile, and that he told Epstein \"I think the world of you\", the day before Epstein began his sentence for soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008. Lord Mandelson said in a letter to staff that \"I deeply regret\" the circumstances of his departure from the British embassy in Washington DC. He said being ambassador had been \"the privilege of my life\" and he continued \"to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein twenty years ago and the plight of his victims\". In October, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lost his prince title and was asked to leave his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, following prolonged scrutiny over his links to Epstein. In the latest release of files on Tuesday, a 2001 email sent by a person identified as \"A\" from \"Balmoral\" to Epstein's accomplice and close associate Ghislaine Maxwell - who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking of minors and other offences- asks: \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\" The BBC has contacted Andrew's team for a response. He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and said he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his [Epstein's] arrest and conviction\".",

      "summary_tr_long": "Nasry Asfura has been declared the winner of Honduras' razor-thin presidential election, after weeks of delays following technical problems and allegations of fraud. The conservative National Party candidate - backed by US President Donald Trump - won with 40.3% of the vote, according to the National Electoral Council (CNE), edging out Salvador Nasralla of the centre-right Liberal Party, who got 39.5%. In a post on X, Asfura said: \"Honduras: I am ready to govern. I will not let you down.\" Meanwhile, Nasralla said at a press conference: \"I will not accept a result built on omissions.\" But he also urged his supporters to remain calm. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged all parties to respect the result \"so that Honduran authorities may ensure a peaceful transition of authority\". But the president of the country's Congress, Luis Redondo, posted saying the result was \"completely illegal\". The vote was held on 30 November but the count was delayed twice by technical outages, which electoral officials called \"inexcusable\". The president of the CNE, Ana Paola Hall, blamed the private company tasked with tabulating the results for the delay. She said the firm had carried out maintenance without warning or checking with the CNE. The stoppage came a day after the portal displaying real-time results had crashed. Results of the election were tight and, because of the tumultuous nature of the processing system, around 15% of the tally sheets had to be counted by hand for the winner to be decided. There have been tensions in Honduras as a result of the delays with protests held across the country last week. Thousands of supporters of the governing Libre party demonstrated in the capital Tegucigalpa over what they considered fraud in the vote. The outgoing President, Xiomara Castro, had alleged that an \"electoral coup\" was taking place and earlier this month said the election was being marred by \"interference\" from Trump. When he endorsed Asfura for president, Trump said there would be \"hell to pay\" if his very narrow lead was overturned in the count. He also threatened to withdraw financial support from the US if Asfura didn't win. In a surprise move, the US president also pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, a member of Asfura's National Party, who was serving a 45-year jail sentence in the US on drug and weapons charges. Castro was barred by the constitution from standing for a second term. Nine days after the vote, Nasralla accused \"corrupt people\" of manipulating the vote count in the Central American nation. He also said Trump's comments had damaged his chances of winning. In his statement following the announcement of the result, Rubio said the US would \"look forward to working with his incoming administration to advance our bilateral and regional security co-operation\", adding the two countries would \"end illegal immigration\" to the US, while strengthening economic ties.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Grigor Atanesian & Investigations Team BBC News Russian t.me/kotovayanora A selfie taken by Alexander Butyagin earlier this year at an ancient site in Crimea A Russian archaeologist detained in Poland is at the centre of an intense debate over the role of museums and experts and the role they play in Kremlin war propaganda. Alexander Butyagin is under arrest in Warsaw, awaiting a Polish court decision on a request to extradite him to Ukraine. Until now, courts across Europe have been reluctant to extradite Russians to Ukraine, citing the European Convention on Human Rights. A senior scholar at the Hermitage, Russia's largest art museum in St Petersburg, he has led the museum's expedition at the site of Myrmekion in Crimea since 1999, well before Russia's illegal landgrab of Ukraine's southern peninsula in 2014. Supporters argue his work has helped preserve Crimea's ancient heritage, but critics say he is no better than a looter of Ukrainian history making the most of Russia's occupation. Getty Images Site of Myrmekion in Crimea Myrmekion dates back to the 6th Century BC, when the Ancient Greeks settled in Crimea as democracy was being born in Athens. Butyagin's expedition has uncovered hundreds of ancient coins at the site, some from Alexander the Great's period in the 4th Century BC. His expedition continued after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine, and a criminal case was opened against him by Ukrainian authorities for working there without authorisation. In November 2024, he was placed on a wanted list, and in April 2025 a Kyiv court ordered his arrest in absentia. Butyagin is accused of illegal excavations and \"illegal partial destruction\" of an archaeological complex. Under the 2nd Protocol to the Hague Convention for the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict, occupying authorities \"shall prohibit and prevent\" any archaeological excavations with only a few, narrow exceptions. AFP via Getty Images Hermitage director Mikhail Piotrovsky has endorsed Vladimir Putin and the invasion of Ukraine Excavations, however ethical, amount to destruction if they take place without permission and under conditions of armed conflict, says Evelina Kravchenko, a senior researcher at the Institute of Archaeology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Butyagin \"violated the Hague Convention, and all his problems stem from that\", says Kravchenko, whose committee issued permits for Russian archaeologists to work in Crimea before its annexation. Butyagin told Russian media last year he was \"simply doing the work we've devoted our lives to\", and that his main goal was preserving monuments. Getty Images This ancient Roman sarcophagus from Myrmekion has been in the Hermitage collection since 1851 The Hermitage press office insisted Butyagin's work complied with all international legal and ethical norms \"regardless of geopolitical circumstances.\" A senior archaeologist from the museum told the BBC that Butyagin had followed the only path available for Russian archaeologists working in Crimea. \"A Russian archaeologist, if he wants to continue his research, has no opportunity to obtain permits from the Ukrainian side, but must obtain them from the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation,\" said the scholar who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to comment on the case. Several Ukrainian sources have also accused Butyagin of \"looting\" objects by taking them to Russia, although these charges are not part of Ukraine's case. Both the archaeologist and the Hermitage insist all their finds remain in Crimea as they are transferred to the Eastern Crimean Museum in Kerch. They argue that objects can only be relocated to Russia temporarily for restoration or as exhibition loans. However, this violates Ukrainian law too, as all discoveries must go into Ukraine's museum fund. Under the terms of Russia's illegal annexation, the Eastern Crimean Museum collection has instead been made part of Russia's museum fund. Since the start of the war, several European courts have refused Ukraine's requests to extradite Russians, citing potential risks under the European Convention, which prohibits politically motivated persecution, violations of the right to a fair trial, and torture and inhuman treatment of detainees. Even if the Polish court deciding Butyagin's case does find sufficient grounds to extradite him, it might not go ahead, says Gleb Bogush, a researcher at the Institute for International Peace and Security Law at the University of Cologne. Last June, Denmark's Supreme Court ruled against extraditing to Ukraine a Russian national suspected of espionage for Moscow. Gleb Bogush says it is primarily the Russian state and its officials that are responsible for Crimean excavations, rather than Butyagin, because it was not up to archaeologists to decide whether the Hermitage expedition should continue. A senior Hermitage employee told the BBC that \"a field archaeologist cannot be a citizen of the world; he deals with officials, obtaining permits and has to look for funding and volunteers\". Butyagin has attracted support not just from the Kremlin but from Russians who oppose Putin and the war. \"The claims being made against him are absurd,\" said Arseny Vesnin, an exiled journalist and historian. He said Butyagin had ensured conservation and preservation of the site he was excavating. Others maintain that artefacts would have been looted by criminals and sold on the black market if Russian archaeologists had refused to work in Crimea. That does not justify their actions, says Samuel Andrew Hardy, a leading British criminologist specialising in the protection of cultural property in conflict zones. Hardy says all that Butyagin's supporters are doing is arguing that ultimately Russia should just be allowed to carry on doing what it wants regardless of the war.",

      "summary_tr_long": "India's solar boom faces a hidden waste problem AFP via Getty Images India gets plenty of sunlight throughout the year, which makes solar power highly efficient India's rapid solar energy expansion is widely hailed as a success. But without a plan to manage the waste it will generate, how clean is the transition? In just over a decade, India has become the world's third-largest solar producer, with renewables now central to its climate strategy. Solar panels are everywhere - from vast solar parks to blue rooftops across cities, towns and villages. Alongside large solar parks, millions of rooftop systems now feed power into the electricity grid. Government data show nearly 2.4 million households have adopted solar under a subsidy scheme. Solar growth has cut India's reliance on coal. Though thermal and other non-renewables still supply over half of installed capacity, solar now contributes more than 20%. Yet the achievement carries a challenge: while clean in use, solar panels can pose environmental risks if not properly managed. Solar panels are mostly recyclable, made of glass, aluminium, silver, and polymers - but trace toxic metals like lead and cadmium can pollute soil and water if mishandled. Solar panels typically last about 25 years, after which they are removed and discarded. India currently has no dedicated budget for solar-waste recycling and only a few small facilities to process old panels. Bloomberg via Getty Images Thermal power plants continue to dominate India's energy generation capacity India has no official data on solar waste, but a study estimated around 100,000 tonnes by 2023, rising to 600,000 tonnes by 2030. For now, the volume is small, but experts warn the bulk is yet to come - and without rapid recycling investment, India could face a growing waste crisis. A new study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) estimates that India could generate more than 11 million tonnes of solar waste by 2047. Managing this would require almost 300 dedicated recycling facilities and an investment of $478 (£362m) over the next two decades. \"Most of India's large solar parks were built in the mid-2010s, so the real wave of waste is coming in 10 to 15 years,\" says Rohit Pahwa of energy company Targray. India's solar-waste projections mirror global patterns: the US may generate 170,000–1 million tonnes and China nearly one million tonnes by 2030, following rapid solar expansion in the 2010s. The policy landscape, however, differs significantly. In the US, solar-panel recycling is mostly market-driven under a patchwork of state rules. China's system, like India's, is still developing and lacks a dedicated regulatory framework. In 2022, India brought solar panels under e-waste rules, making manufacturers responsible for collecting, storing, dismantling and recycling them at end of life. Experts say enforcement is uneven, especially for home and small-scale panels, which make up 5–10% of installations. Though modest, these panels can still generate substantial waste, as they are harder to track, collect, and recycle. Damaged or discarded panels often end up in landfills or with unauthorised recyclers, where unsafe methods can release toxic materials. The BBC has contacted India's renewable energy ministry for comment. Hindustan Times via Getty Images Damaged and ageing rooftop panels are rarely recycled \"Solar power gives an illusion of clean energy for two decades, but without a serious plan for recycling panels it risks leaving behind a graveyard of modules and not much of a legacy,\" says environment expert Sai Bhaskar Reddy Nakka. Despite the challenges, experts say the problem is not without opportunities. \"As waste rises, so will the demand for companies that know how to process it,\" Mr Pahwa says. Efficient recycling could reclaim 38% of materials for new panels by 2047 and prevent 37 million tonnes of carbon emissions from mining, says CEEW. India already has markets for glass and aluminium, and metals found in solar cells - silicon, silver, and copper - can be recovered for new panels or other industries, says Akansha Tyagi, co-author of the study. Currently, most solar waste is processed with basic methods that recover only low-value materials like glass and aluminium, while precious metals are lost, damaged or extracted in tiny amounts. Experts say the next decade will be decisive for India's solar goals. The country must act fast - building a regulated, self-sustaining recycling system, raising household awareness, and integrating waste collection into solar business models. Companies that profit from solar power should also be responsible for what happens to panels once they stop working, says Mr Nakka. \"Without proper recycling, clean energy today could mean more waste tomorrow,\" he warned.

Emails between 'A' and Maxwell about 'girls' Of the thousands of pages included in this latest release, one 2001 email sent by a person identified as \"A\" stands out. \"A\" then asks Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking of minors and other offences: \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\" In another email sent later that day, Maxwell writes back: \"So sorry to dissapoint [sic] you, however the truth must be told. I have only been able to find appropriate friends.\" The \"A\" email was sent from the address abx17@dial.pipex.com, with the sender's name shown as \"The Invisible Man\". FBI email suggests 10 possible 'co-conspirators' US Department of Justice The name of Ghislaine Maxwell (R) is one of two names not redacted on an FBI list Among the documents released are emails appearing to be sent between FBI personnel in 2019 that mention 10 possible \"co-conspirators\" of Epstein. Another email sent to FBI New York gives an update on the co-conspirators. The email is presumably referring to Former Victoria's Secret CEO Les Wexner, who had a public friendship with Epstein. In 2019, Wexner said he was \"embarrassed\" by his ties to the financier. Lawyers for Wexner told BBC News that \"the assistant US attorney in charge of the Epstein investigation stated at the time that Mr Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target\". \"There's 10 co-conspirators, potentially, that we knew nothing about, that the DoJ had been investigating,\" Democratic Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told BBC News on Tuesday. The handwritten letter and envelope appeared to show Epstein writing to Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics doctor who is serving decades in prison for sexually abusing young female athletes. \"We shared one thing…our love & caring for young ladies and the hope they'd reach their full potential.\" The writer signs the letter off: \"Life is unfair, Yours, J Epstein.\" The letter had been deemed undeliverable, and was sent - apparently as a return - to the Manhattan jail in which Epstein was detained before his death in 2019. The released documents show that the FBI was alerted to the letter and requested an analysis of it. It was also postmarked on 13 August 2019, three days after Epstein died. The documents released on Tuesday also show the analysis request by the FBI. A FBI laboratory request stated that in August 2019, a sender listed as \"J Epstein\" at \"Manhattan Correctional\" tried to send a letter to \"Larry Nassar at 9300 S Wilmot Road, Tucson, Arizona, 85756\", the address of a federal prison. Among these files is an email from January 2020, in which a federal prosecutor in New York wrote that newly received flight records \"reflect that Donald Trump traveled on Epstein's private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware)\". Trump was listed as a passenger on \"at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996\", and Ghislaine Maxwell was present on at least four of those flights, the prosecutor wrote. Trump was previously married to Marla Maples, Tiffany's mother, from 1993 to 1999. The prosecutor also wrote that \"on one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old\", with the third passenger's name redacted. \"On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case.\" The timing of Trump's alleged trips coincide with the years that were examined by federal prosecutors for Maxwell's conduct and travels as part of the criminal case they brought against her. In a statement accompanying Tuesday's release, the DoJ said the new files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election\". The statement continued: \"To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.\" Fake video of Epstein included Among one of the odder entries in Tuesday's document drop was a fake video showing an Epstein-like figure in a prison cell. Other documents showed that a man from Florida sent an email to federal investigators in March 2021 with a link to the video. BBC Verify used a reverse image search to find a copy of the video had been uploaded to YouTube in October 2020. The user who posted it said the clip had been created using 3D graphics. According to a 2023 report by the Bureau of Prisons, no video recording from inside Epstein's cell on the day of his death exists.

      "summary_tr_long": "Rivalries and rumours: How the new order of the Murdoch dynasty is playing out Katie Razzall Culture and Media Editor BBC Listen to this article Christmas is a time when families get together if they can - and, until this year, the Murdochs were no different. With members of the media dynasty spread across the globe, full family gatherings were rare, although in 2008, according to biographer Michael Wolff, the Murdochs spent the festive season together on a flotilla of private yachts. WireImage Elisabeth Murdoch and two of her siblings, James and Prudence, have been cut out of the family firm Rupert's eldest child by his second wife, Elisabeth is the co-founder and executive chairman of the production company, Sister, which is behind hit television series, including Black Doves, The Split and This is Going To Hurt. Money doesn't compensate for a father who, in his mid-90s, decided to rip his family apart because he believed it was in the interests of his business. The Murdochs have never been a traditional family - one reason why their story is said to have inspired the power struggles and backstabbing in the acclaimed TV drama, Succession. And as one person put it to me, the TV show concluded too early by killing off Logan Roy: there was more drama to come. Earlier this year, he described his dad as a \"misogynist\" in an interview in US magazine The Atlantic, and referred to some of Rupert's behaviour in the courtroom fight as \"twisted\". Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images James Murdoch's relationship with his father Rupert and older brother Lachlan now appears irreconcilable (L-R, James Murdoch, Anna Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch) Lachlan, who Rupert had already chosen to run the business, is now - definitively - the only one who will take the reins after his father's demise. The trust had been set up in 1999, when Rupert divorced Anna, the mother of Lachlan, Elisabeth and James. Ironically, his successful leadership of Fox Corp, where he's been CEO since 2019 (he became chairman of Fox and also News Corp in 2023 when his father became chairman emeritus), made the deal more costly. Their father turned 94 in March, with the court battle in full swing. Fox Corp may operate out of the US, but he is said to prefer the laid-back nature of Australian life, even if the trade-off is business calls in the middle of the night because of the time difference, as well as a lot of flights. He's never going to want to say, 'Hey, that's me,' and so I think it's a little hard to come out from Dad's shadow.\" At the same time, Rodney Benson, professor of media, culture, and communication at New York University, says that while Rupert remains a presence in the company \"what's really unique about Lachlan's approach, or what will be unique about his approach, won't fully emerge\". In September, US President Donald Trump said Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch were expected to be part of a group of investors trying to buy TikTok in the US. On Thursday, TikTok parent company ByteDance announced to staff that it had signed an agreement to sell a portion of TikTok to a group of mostly US based investors. Reuters Under Lachlan Murdoch's leadership, the company has pursued a strategy centred on digital and streaming growth Presenting the Fox Corporation's results for July to September, Lachlan said Tubi had achieved rapid revenue growth and growth in view time, confirming its position as the top premium advertising-based video-on-demand platform in the US. Rupert Murdoch's 70-year career saw him as \"both an interventionist editor-in-chief figure and a political kingmaker\", according to Paddy Manning, an investigative journalist who wrote The Successor: The High-Stakes Life of Lachlan Murdoch. From digital real estate to sports betting to commercial radio to Tubi, Lachlan's investment decisions are focused on the bottom line, not burnishing his political credentials.\" But Prof Benson suggests the significant debt the Murdoch businesses have taken on as part of the settlement with Lachlan's siblings increases pressure to make profit, and therefore to pursue \"politically sensationalistic… outrage journalism\". I'm told he spent nearly two weeks in London and was in the News UK office most days. Rupert's been described to me, at 94, as still \"the sharpest person in the room\" and a \"phenomenon who loves papers and has ink in his veins\". AFP via Getty Images Rupert Murdoch recently attended a state banquet at Windsor Castle as a guest of US President Donald Trump At one point the editor of the Times introduced Rupert to a slightly startled young journalist on the newsdesk and asked him to show the boss the paper's recently launched Live app and what it showed around reader engagement on specific stories. Presciently, Anna Murdoch - Lachlan, James and Elisabeth's mother - predicted much of the fallout back in the 1980s. Getty Images Anna Murdoch, the mother of Lachlan, James and Elisabeth, warned that family divisions could emerge (L - R, Lachlan, James, Rupert, Elisabeth and Anna) A decade after it was published - by which time the pair had divorced and Rupert had married third wife Wendi Deng - Anna gave an interview to an Australian women's magazine, during which she was asked which of her children would be best suited to take over from her ex-husband.

      "summary_tr_long": "Lebo Diseko Global Religion correspondent Getty Images Pope Leo has criticised the Trump administration's immigration policy Jesse Romero, a conservative Catholic podcaster, has some choice words for Pope Leo XIV. \"He has no authority over the government; he has to stay in his lane.\" As a Donald Trump supporter, he is angry about criticism made by the American-born Pope and US bishops about his mass deportation policy. Catholics like Vice President JD Vance, and influential legal activist Leonard Leo, were an important part of Donald Trump's electoral success. Instead, Pope Leo XIV has spoken repeatedly about his concerns over how migrants are treated in the US, calling for \"deep reflection\" on the matter in November. The pontiff evoked the gospel of Matthew, adding that \"Jesus says very clearly, at the end of the world, we're going to be asked, 'How did you receive the foreigner?\" A week later the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), issued a rare \"Special Message\" voicing their \"concern for the evolving situation impacting immigrants in the United States\". It was a significant intervention, the first time the USCCB had used such a communique in a dozen years. Getty Images Chicago has been a focus of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement Picking a fight with the Pope \"I think the relationship is quite tense,\" says David Gibson, director of Fordham University's Center on Religion and Culture. Conservatives had hoped that Pope Leo would bring a change from his predecessor Pope Francis's focus on issues of social justice and migration, according to Gibson. White House border czar, Tom Homan - himself a Catholic - has said that the Church \"is wrong\", and that its leaders \"need to spend time fixing the Catholic Church\". And in October, the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected the Chicago born Pope's suggestion that US treatment of immigrants was \"inhuman\" and not in line with \"pro-life\" beliefs. Gibson argues that the government's calculation \"is that there are enough American Catholics, especially white American Catholics, who support the Republican Party and Donald Trump, that it's politically beneficial at the end of the day to pick a fight with the Pope. That's an unprecedented calculus.\" Nearly 60% of white Catholics approve of how Trump is handling immigration, according to a new study by the think tank the Public Religion Research Institute. That figure is around 30% for Hispanics, who are 37% of the US Catholic population. Getty Images US Vice President JD Vance has been vocal about how his Catholic faith has influenced his politics The growing power and prominence of right-wing Catholics in the political sphere is exemplified by JD Vance, a convert to the religion who says his politics are shaped by his faith. Although he has argued that current policy is not at odds with Church teaching, he has also said that there is a responsibility to remember the humanity of people who are in the country illegally. In November, Ms Rattenbury took part in a 2,000 strong celebration of Mass outside an ICE detention centre in the Broadview neighbourhood of Chicago. The \"People's Mass\" was one of a series of actions by the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership (CSPL). The CSPL has now filed a federal lawsuit alleging it was blocked from providing religious ministry. St Susanna Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, replaced baby Jesus with a hand-painted notice saying \"ICE was here\". Some in the community have complained, and the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston ordered that the display be removed, saying it was divisive and contravened rules on sacred objects. While many US Catholics maintain conservative positions on issues such as abortion, in line with that of the Church, they are also more likely to see themselves as progressive than white evangelical Christians, who overwhelmingly voted Republican in the last three elections. And nearly a third of Catholics in the US were born in other countries. \"The Catholic brand in the United States is an immigrant church.\" Getty Images Clergy say they have been blocked from giving Eucharist to migrants at an Illinois detention facility 'Inconsistent with the Gospel' Bishop Joseph Tyson of Yakima, Washington State, was one of the 216 who supported the USCCB's Special Message. \"We see a lot more positives in those immigrants.\" He says he is not arguing for open borders, a point that Pope Leo has also made, but is against \"indiscriminate deportation\". He estimates that around half of the families in his predominantly Hispanic diocese have someone in their household facing some sort of issue with their immigration status. Bishop Tyson says that more than a third of clergy he has ordained have at some point been on a temporary visa before gaining a green card, a process that in the current climate can feel precarious. He's on a T-visa, but [ICE] showed up, and he was afraid that he was going to be picked up,\" he said. \"Anybody can have their paperwork revoked, [so] we have our men carrying their papers with them at all times.\" Bishop Tyson argues that current US policy goes against Catholic teaching. It is inconsistent with the Gospel of Life.\" For Jesse Romero though, it is US bishops and the Pope who are going against Catholic doctrine. He argues the Catechism - which summarises the teachings of the Church - is clear that immigrants should keep to all laws, including those about whether they should be in the country. \"We have a large swath of bishops in the Catholic Church of America that have a more modernist, liberal, progressive view of Scripture and theology.\" Romero says he prays for their conversion.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Two British campaigners are among five people denied US visas after the State Department accused them of seeking to \"coerce\" American tech platforms into suppressing free speech. Imran Ahmed, an ex-Labour adviser who now heads the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), and Clare Melford, CEO of the Global Disinformation Index (GDI), were labelled \"radical activists\" by the Trump administration and banned from entering the US. A French ex-EU commissioner and two senior figures at a Germany-based anti-online hate group were also denied visas. European leaders have condemned the measures, while the UK government said it is \"fully committed\" to upholding free speech. \"While every country has the right to set its own visa rules, we support the laws and institutions which are working to keep the internet free from the most harmful content,\" a UK government spokesperson said. French President Emmanuel Macron described the travel ban as \"intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty\" while the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was \"unacceptable and an attempt to challenge our sovereignty\". The US billed the measures as a response to people and organisations that have campaigned for restrictions on American tech firms, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying they belonged to a \"global censorship-industrial complex\". He said: \"President Trump has been clear that his America First foreign policy rejects violations of American sovereignty. Extraterritorial overreach by foreign censors targeting American speech is no exception.\" Ahmed from the CCDH, which says it advocates for government action against hate speech and disinformation online, has links to senior Labour figures. He was previously an aide to Labour minister Hilary Benn, and Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney has served as a director of the group he founded. The US government labelled Ahmed a \"collaborator\" for the CCDH's purported past work with the Biden administration. BBC News has contacted the CCDH for comment. Melford founded the GDI, a non-profit that monitors the spread of disinformation, in 2018. US Undersecretary of State Sarah B Rogers accused the GDI of using US taxpayer money \"to exhort censorship and blacklisting of American speech and press\". A GDI spokesperson told the BBC that \"the visa sanctions announced today are an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship\". \"The Trump Administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor, and silence voices they disagree with. Their actions today are immoral, unlawful, and un-American.\" Also targeted was Thierry Breton, the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, who suggested that a \"witch hunt\" was taking place. Breton was described by the State Department as the \"mastermind\" of the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), which imposes content moderation on social media firms. However, it has angered some US conservatives who see it as seeking to censor right-wing opinions. Breton has clashed with Elon Musk, the world's richest man and owner of X, over obligations to follow EU rules. The European Commission recently fined X €120m (£105m) over its blue tick badges - the first fine under the DSA . It said the platform's blue tick system was \"deceptive\" because the firm was not \"meaningfully verifying users\". In response, Musk's site blocked the Commission from sharing adverts on its platform. Reacting to the visa ban, Breton posted on X: \"To our American friends: Censorship isn't where you think it is.\" Also subject to bans were Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon of HateAid, a German organisation that the State Department said helped enforce the DSA. In a statement to the BBC, the two CEOs called it an \"act of repression by a government that is increasingly disregarding the rule of law and trying to silence its critics by any means necessary\". They added: \"We will not be intimidated by a government that uses accusations of censorship to silence those who stand up for human rights and freedom of expression.\"",

      "summary_tr_long": "TikTok removes AI weight loss ads from fake Boots account Jamie Ryan BBC Social News BBC Some of the posts falsely claiming to be from Boots, using the store's logo Fake adverts for weight loss drugs by a company pretending to be health and beauty retailer Boots have been removed from TikTok after the firm complained. The adverts for prescription-only weight loss drugs appeared to show smiling healthcare professionals from the British retailer - but in reality they were made with AI. It is illegal to advertise prescription-only weight loss drugs to the public. A spokesperson for Boots told the BBC the firm was \"aware\" of the videos and had complained to TikTok, which said it had removed the videos. A TikTok spokesperson said it did not allow \"harmful or misleading AI-generated ads\" on its platform. But the BBC found while the videos were removed, the account - seemingly located in Hong Kong - was not. It was able to re-upload the exact same videos despite the originals being removed. TikTok was again notified of this, and the user was subsequently deleted. Weight-loss jabs have been available on the NHS in England since the end of June, but they are not available over-the-counter and patients must meet strict criteria in order to be eligible for a prescription. Before the fake Boots account was removed, its videos linked to a website where weight loss drugs could be bought. It featured testimonies from customers and doctors which were either made with AI or taken from other websites. The TikTok videos showed what appeared to be health workers drinking from a vial of blue liquid. This would then appear to jump forward several months, with the workers apparently having lost a drastic amount of weight. \"AI now makes it trivially easy to generate a convincing series of videos or images showing an apparent change in a plausibly real generic health professional, or to impersonate specific health professionals wholesale,\" AI expert Sam Gregory told the BBC. \"The underlying question is how quickly and comprehensively platforms act when they detect - or are notified of - scams that clearly breach their terms of service. \"Major brands like Boots will get prioritised over an individual business owner who's been targeted.\" 'Serious risks' to health Other videos uploaded by the same account on TikTok seemed to have used content originally posted by real people, showcasing their weight-loss journey, but repurposed and used without permission. All of the videos used similar branding and names to that of the official Boots account on TikTok - using the handle \"@BootsOfficial\". Boots said it only runs adverts on social media through its actual account @BootsUK. The website also included warnings from the MHRA, the UK's governmental body that ensures medicines and medical devices are safe, about purchasing counterfeit products. A spokesperson for the body told the BBC weight loss medicines \"should only be obtained from a registered pharmacy against a prescription issued by a healthcare professional\". \"Taking these medicines sourced in any other way carries serious risks to your health with no guarantees about what they contain,\" they said. TikTok said it would continue to \"strengthen\" its detection methods for AI-generated content and it does not allow \"the depiction, promotion, or trade of controlled substances\".",

The influential video game developer was travelling in a Ferrari with another person, when it crashed and caught fire on a highway in Los Angeles on Sunday. \"This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince's family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work,\" a spokesperson for Electronic Arts told the BBC. Officials said the person on the vehicle's passenger seat was ejected while the driver remained trapped. It is unclear if Zampella was driving the car and who the other person inside was. \"For unknown reasons, the vehicle veered off the roadway, struck a concrete barrier, and became fully engulfed,\" the California Highway Patrol said in a statement to the BBC. Zampella created Call of Duty with his long time collaborators Jason West and Grant Collier in 2003. Partly inspired by events in World War II, the game has sold more than 500 million copies making owners Microsoft's Activision one of the most profitable gaming companies. It has also spawned an upcoming live-action film. The Call of Duty franchise was not his only success. He was also behind other widely popular games including the Medal of Honor, Titanfall and Apex Legends. Journalist and Game Awards host Geoff Keighley, who wrote a book about the making of Titanfall , called Zampella a \"dear friend\" in a post on X and a \"visionary executive\" who \"never wavered in his commitment to honesty and transparency\". \"While he created some of the most influential games of our time, I always felt he still had his greatest one ahead of him,\" he said. \"It's heartbreaking that we'll never get to play it.\" \"He really cared about the player experience,\" Keza MacDonald, the Guardian's video games editor, told BBC Newshour. \"He cared about making games, he cared about how people felt when they played and that really came across whenever you spoke to him.\" YouTuber MrRoflWaffles, whose Call of Duty videos have amassed him more than 2.4 million subscribers, credited the developer for inspiring \"a whole generation\" with the franchise, including his own content. \"You talk about the Mount Rushmore of gaming - he's absolutely staple on that list of people,\" he told BBC Newsbeat. In 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Activision, which publishes the Call of Duty games, and the pair were subsequently locked in a long dispute with the company which they settled out of court in 2012. At Electronic Arts, Zampella worked on Battlefield 6, which is seen as a direct competitor to Call of Duty. Infinity Ward, the American company that developed Call of Duty, said Zampella \"will always have a special place in our history\". \"Your legacy of creating iconic, lasting entertainment is immeasurable,\" the company said in a statement on X.",

North Koreans tried to apply for remote working IT jobs using stolen or fake identities, Amazon's chief security officer Stephen Schmidt said in a LinkedIn post. \"Their objective is typically straightforward: get hired, get paid, and funnel wages back to fund the regime's weapons programs,\" he said, adding that this trend is likely to be happening at scale across the industry, especially in the US. Authorities in the US and South Korea have warned about Pyongyang's operatives carrying out online scams. Amazon has seen a nearly one-third increase in job applications from North Koreans in the past year, said Mr Schmidt in his post . He said the operatives typically work with people managing \"laptop farms\" - referring to computers based in the US that are run remotely from outside of the country. The firm used a combination of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and verification by its staff to screen job applications, he said. The strategies used by such fraudsters have become more sophisticated, Mr Schmidt said. Bad actors are hijacking dormant LinkedIn accounts using leaked credentials to gain verification. They target genuine software engineers to appear credible, he said, urging firms to report suspicious job applications to the authorities. Mr Schmidt warned employers to look out for indicators of fraudulent North Korean job applications, including incorrectly formatted phone numbers and mismatched education histories. In June, the US government said it had uncovered 29 \"laptop farms\" that were being operated illegally across the country by North Korean IT workers. They used stolen or forged identities of Americans to help North Korean nationals get jobs in the US, said the Department of Justice (DOJ). It also indicted US brokers who had helped secure jobs for the North Korean operatives. In July, a woman from Arizona was sentenced to more than eight years in jail for running a laptop farm to help North Korean IT workers secure remote jobs at more than 300 US companies. The DOJ said the scheme generated more than $17m (£12.6m) in illicit gains for her and Pyongyang.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Uber and Lyft announce plans to trial Chinese robotaxis in UK in 2026 Liv McMahon Technology reporter Bloomberg via Getty Images Baidu's driverless Apollo Go taxis are already on roads in China, Hong Kong and Dubai Chinese robotaxis could be set to hit UK roads in 2026 as ride-sharing apps Uber and Lyft announce partnerships with Baidu to trial the tech. The two companies are hoping to obtain approval from regulators to test the autonomous vehicles in London. Baidu's Apollo Go driverless taxi service already operates in dozens of cities, mostly in China, and has accrued millions of rides without a human behind the wheel. Transport secretary Heidi Alexander said the news was \"another vote of confidence in our plans for self-driving vehicles\" - but many remain sceptical about their safety. \"We're planning for self-driving cars to carry passengers for the first time from spring, under our pilot scheme – harnessing this technology safely and responsibly to transform travel,\" Ms Alexander said in a post on X . Uber said in June it would bring its plans to trial UK driverless cars forward as the government sought to accelerate framework to allow pilots of small autonomous \"bus and taxi like\" commercial services in 2026. \"We're excited to accelerate Britain's leadership in the future of mobility, bringing another safe and reliable travel option to Londoners next year,\" it said of its Baidu partnership on Monday. Lyft said in August it would look to deploy driverless taxis in the UK and Germany as part of a European agreement with Baidu. It already operates \"autonomous rides\" in Atlanta, US - where Uber also operates a robotaxi service through its partnership with Waymo. Lyft chief executive David Risher said in a post on X on Monday London passengers would be \"the first in the region to experience Baidu's Apollo Go vehicles\". But both firms still need to convince regulators. Mr Risher said if green lit, Lyft's initial fleet of dozens of Baidu Apollo Go cars would begin testing next year \"with plans to scale to hundreds from there\". But Jack Stilgoe, professor of science and technology policy at University College London, said driverless cars \"can't just scale up like other digital technologies\". \"There's a big difference between having a few test vehicles using public streets as their laboratory and a fully-developed, scaled-up system that becomes a real transport option for people,\" he told the BBC. Congestion concerns Self-driving vehicles have often been lauded as the future of transport, with some claiming they make fewer errors than human drivers. But many people remain uneasy about the safety of taxis without a human operator. Almost 60% of UK respondents to a YouGov poll in October said they would not feel comfortable riding in a driverless taxi under any circumstances. Many also expressed a lack of trust in the tech, with 85% saying they would opt for a cab with a human driver if given the same price and convenience. Instances of autonomous vehicles making mistakes, trapping passengers in cars and causing traffic jams or accidents also continue to make headlines. Self-driving taxi operator Waymo reportedly suspended its service in San Francisco on Saturday after some of its vehicles stopped working during a power cut. Prof Stilgoe said amid concerns about their safety, as well as privacy and the potential to add to congestion, the UK should lead in \"setting standards for the technology\". \"London has been really successful at getting cars out of its city centre,\" he said. \"When it comes to traffic, the only thing worse than a single-occupancy car is a zero-occupancy one.\"",

      "summary_tr_long": "Will the US TikTok deal make it safer but less relevant? Laura Cress, Technology reporter and Lily Jamali, North America technology correspondent, San Francisco Getty Images TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance has signed a deal with investors to run its business in the US. But what does this mean for the over 170 million Americans (or so the social media platform claims) who use the app? The key may lie in how TikTok's recommendation algorithm - the powerful system that curates the platform's For You Page to predict content you might watch - is managed when it changes hands. Social media industry expert Matt Navarra told the BBC the question will not be whether TikTok survives, but \"what version of TikTok survives\". 'Smoothing out the edges' Currently, TikTok's system depends on huge amounts of global data and feedback loops, which can change recommendations in an instant. Under the terms of the deal TikTok's algorithm, which will be licensed by investor Oracle, is set to be retrained on American user data. Mr Navarra said this could leave the app feeling \"safer and sturdier\" but also leaving it at a risk of \"becoming less culturally essential\" as a result. \"TikTok's power has always come from feeling slightly out of control - weird, niche, uncomfortable, sometimes politically sharp content for anyone else or before it goes anywhere else,\" he said. \"If you start smoothing those edges, you don't just change moderation. I think you change its relevance.\" Matching ByteDance's algorithm Whether the US version will differ from the TikTok so many know and use already may also depend on if it gets \"all the new features, security updates and platform improvements\" as soon as the international version does, tech journalist Will Guyatt told the BBC. And computing expert Kokil Jaidka from the National University of Singapore said she expected the things that make the platform popular - such as its short videos and shopping - are likely to \"stay intact\" as these features are not dependent on the algorithm. She said the changes might be more subtle and gradual, depending on if the narrower data inputs of the \"siloed\" US version can match the app's global reach. \"If TikTok is operating with a licensed or partially diluted version of its recommendation algorithm, some of the system's blind spots may start to matter more,\" she said. For users, she said this means in practice the US algorithm may \"lag in personalisation\" and take longer to adapt to viral content. Oracle is TikTok's longtime cloud computing partner in the United States, and is chaired by Larry Ellison, an ally of President Trump. Another foreign entity, MGX - an Abu-Dhabi government investment fund - will join it along with private equity firm Silver Lake as the main incoming investors. Pressure from these investors may also add to the US app feeling \"blander\" said Mr Navarra. \"I think the real test won't be whether the users leave,\" he said. \"It will be whether TikTok still feels the place the internet goes to experiment - or if it becomes the place it goes to behave.\" Additional reporting by Peter Hoskins.",

      "summary_tr_long": "TikTok owner signs deal to avoid US ban Peter Hoskins, business reporter and Lily Jamali, North America technology correspondent Watch: What does TikTok's deal mean for America's users? TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance has signed binding agreements with American and global investors to operate its business in the US, the video platform's boss told employees on Thursday. Half of the joint venture will be owned by a group of investors including Oracle, Silver Lake and the Emirati investment firm MGX, according to a memo sent by chief executive Shou Zi Chew. The deal, which is set to close on 22 January, would end years of efforts by Washington to force ByteDance to sell its US operations over national security concerns. It is in ​line with a deal unveiled in September, when US President Donald Trump delayed the enforcement of a law that would ban the app unless it was sold. TikTok said in the memo that the deal would enable \"over 170 million Americans to continue discovering a world of endless possibilities as part of a vital global community\". Under the agreement, ByteDance will retain 19.9% of the business, while Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will hold 15% each. Another 30.1% will be held by affiliates of existing ByteDance investors, according to the memo. The White House previously said that Oracle, which was co-founded by Trump supporter Larry Ellison, will license TikTok's recommendation algorithm as part of the deal. The deal comes after a series of delays. In April 2024, during President Joe Biden's administration, the US Congress passed a law to ban the app over national security concerns, unless it was sold. The law was set to go into effect on 20 January 2025 but was pushed back multiple times by Trump while his administration worked out a deal to transfer ownership. Trump said in September that he had spoken on the phone to China's President Xi Jinping, who he said had given the deal the go-ahead. The platform's future remained unclear after the leaders met face-to-face in October. The app's fate was clouded by ongoing tensions between the two nations on other matters including trade. \"TikTok has become a bargaining chip in the wider US-China relationship,\" said Alvin Graylin, a lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"With recent softening tensions, Beijing's sign-off on the structure and algorithm licensing now looks less like capitulation and more like calibrated de-escalation, letting both capitals claim a win at home.\" The White House referred the BBC to TikTok when contacted for comment. Oracle and Silver Lake declined to comment. The deal drew critiques from Senate Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon, who said it would not do \"a thing to protect the privacy of American user\". Under the terms, TikTok's recommendation algorithm is set to be retrained on US user data to ensure feeds are free from external manipulation. \"It's unclear that it will even put TikTok's algorithm in safer hands,\" said Wyden. He opposed the 2024 law and was among US lawmakers who lobbied to extend the TikTok deadline in January in a bid to give Congress more time to mitigate threats from China. Some users also expressed caution at the prospect of new investors. Small business owner Tiffany Cianci, who has more than 300,000 followers and nearly four million likes on the platform, said she hopes the incoming investors will maintain the same user experience for entrepreneurs like her. \"I hope small business owners are protected,\" she said. TikTok has said that more than seven million small businesses market their products and services on TikTok in the US. \"I reserve judgement on whether or not we have saved the app for those small businesses,\" Ms Cianci said. She added that she chose TikTok for promotion because the platform offered profit-sharing on terms that are more favourable than what competitors like Meta offered. Over the last year, Ms Cianci has been active in organising protests in Washington and on TikTok aimed at saving the app.",

      "summary_tr_long": "UK to ban deepfake AI 'nudification' apps Liv McMahon Technology reporter Getty Images The UK government says it will ban so-called \"nudification\" apps as part of efforts to tackle misogyny online. New laws - announced on Thursday as part of a wider strategy to halve violence against women and girls - will make it illegal to create and supply AI tools letting users edit images to seemingly remove someone's clothing. The new offences would build on existing rules around sexually explicit deepfakes and intimate image abuse, the government said. \"Women and girls deserve to be safe online as well as offline,\" said Technology Secretary Liz Kendall. \"We will not stand by while technology is weaponised to abuse, humiliate and exploit them through the creation of non-consensual sexually explicit deepfakes.\" Creating deepfake explicit images of someone without their consent is already a criminal offence under the Online Safety Act. Ms Kendall said the new offence - which makes it illegal to create or distribute nudifying apps - would mean \"those who profit from them or enable their use will feel the full force of the law\". Nudification or \"de-clothing\" apps use generative AI to realistically make it look like a person has been stripped of their clothing in an image or video. Experts have issued warnings about the rise of such apps and the potential for fake nude imagery to inflict serious harm on victims - particularly when used to create child sexual abuse material (CSAM). In April, the Children's Commissioner for England Dame Rachel de Souza called for a total ban on nudification apps . \"The act of making such an image is rightly illegal – the technology enabling it should also be,\" she said in a report . The government said on Thursday it would \"join forces with tech companies\" to develop methods to combat intimate image abuse. This would include continuing its work with UK safety tech firm SafeToNet, it said. The UK company developed AI software it claimed could identify and block sexual content, as well as block cameras when they detect sexual content is being captured. Such tech builds on existing filters implemented by platforms such as Meta to detect and flag potential nudity in imagery, often with the aim of stopping children taking or sharing intimate images of themselves. 'No reason to exist' Plans to ban nudifying apps come after previous calls from child protection charities for the government to crack down on the tech. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) - whose Report Remove helpline allows under-18s to confidentially report explicit images of themselves online - said 19% of confirmed reporters had said some or all of their imagery had been manipulated. Its chief executive Kerry Smith welcomed the measures. \"We are also glad to see concrete steps to ban these so-called nudification apps which have no reason to exist as a product,\" she said. \"Apps like this put real children at even greater risk of harm, and we see the imagery produced being harvested in some of the darkest corners of the internet.\" However while children's charity the NSPCC welcomed the news, its director of strategy Dr Maria Neophytou said it was \"disappointed\" to not see similar \"ambition\" to introduce mandatory device-level protections. The charity is among organisations calling on the government to make tech firms find easier ways to identify and prevent spread of CSAM on their services, such as in private messages. The government said on Thursday it would make it \"impossible\" for children to take, share or view a nude image on their phones. It is also seeking to outlaw AI tools designed to create or distribute CSAM .",

      "summary_tr_long": "£100 contactless card limit to be lifted Kevin Peachey Cost of living correspondent Convenient or dangerous? Shoppers react to contactless card limit lift announcement Millions of people will be able to set their own contactless card payment limits or even have no limit at all, a regulator has confirmed. Banks and card providers will be given the power, from March, to set a maximum - or unlimited - single payment amount without the need to enter a four-digit PIN. But they are also being encouraged by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to allow cardholders to set their own individual limits, or switch off contactless entirely. The move comes despite the FCA's own survey showing little appetite among consumers and industry respondents for a change from the current £100 limit on contactless cards. The FCA said it did not expect card providers to make immediate changes to the current limit from March, but they had the flexibility to do so. When contactless card payments were introduced in 2007, the transaction limit was set at £10. The limit was raised gradually, to £15 in 2010, to £20 in 2012, then to £30 in 2015, before the Covid pandemic prompted a jump to £45 in 2020, then to £100 in October 2021. While contactless cards currently have a £100 payment limit, anyone using their smartphone to pay can spend any amount without the need for a PIN. In-built security features, such as thumbprints and face ID, provide greater protection. But concerns have been raised about cards becoming more attractive to thieves and fraudsters, when high-value payments can be made with a tap of a card. Various protections are already in place, such as a prompt to enter a PIN after a series of consecutive contactless transactions are made. Consumers would still get their money back if it was stolen by fraudsters, according to David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA. \"Contactless is people's favoured way to pay,\" he said. Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Mr Geale said while the system works well, rigid limits could \"slow things down\". \"So what we want to do is give banks and payment firms greater flexibility to set their own approach to contactless payment, where they see low risk of fraud,\" he said. In practice, he said that means banks and payment companies could choose a limit based on their customers. \"But what we're really encouraging is that they'll open up that flexibility for customers to set their own limits,\" he added. Other countries, such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand allow industry to set contactless card limits. Jana Mackintosh, managing director of payments and innovation at UK Finance, which represents banks, said: \"Any changes made in the future will be done carefully and ensure strong security and fraud controls remain in place.\" Getty Images Temptation to spend? The FCA's own survey on changing the rules, released during consultation, showed that 78% of consumers who responded said they did not want any change to the current limits. Consumers and academics have suggested that the extra convenience of unlimited contactless payment limits could also lead to shoppers spending without thinking . This is said to be a particular issue with credit cards, when people are spending borrowed money and accumulating debt. Financial abuse charities have also warned that unlimited contactless spending could give abusers free access to drain a survivor's bank account with no checks or alerts. They also worry it could also hasten the shift towards a cashless society, despite notes and coins being a lifeline to many financial abuse survivors whose card transactions are monitored online by their abusers. One policy to help vulnerable customers access cash, as bank branches close, is the development of shared banking hubs. Cash Access UK, the organisation set up to protect access to cash across the UK, announced the official opening of its 200th banking hub in Billericay, Essex, on Friday.

      "summary_tr_long": "One in three using AI for emotional support and conversation, UK says Chris Vallance Senior technology reporter Getty Images One in three adults in the UK are using artificial intelligence (AI) for emotional support or social interaction, according to research published by a government body. And one in 25 people turned to the tech for support or conversation every day, the AI Security Institute (AISI) said in its first report . The report is based on two years of testing the abilities of more than 30 unnamed advanced AIs - covering areas critical to security, including cyber skills, chemistry and biology. The government said AISI's work would support its future plans by helping companies fix problems \"before their AI systems are widely used\". A survey by AISI of over 2,000 UK adults found people were primarily using chatbots like ChatGPT for emotional support or social interaction, followed by voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa. Researchers also analysed what happened to an online community of more than two million Reddit users dedicated to discussing AI companions, when the tech failed. The researchers found when the chatbots went down, people reported self-described \"symptoms of withdrawal\", such as feeling anxious or depressed - as well as having disrupted sleep or neglecting their responsibilities. Doubling cyber skills As well as the emotional impact of AI use, AISI researchers looked at other risks caused by the tech's accelerating capabilities. There is considerable concern about AI enabling cyber attacks, but equally it can be used to help secure systems from hackers. Its ability to spot and exploit security flaws was in some cases \"doubling every eight months\", the report suggests. And AI systems were also beginning to complete expert-level cyber tasks which would typically require over 10 years of experience. Researchers also found the tech's impact in science was also growing rapidly. In 2025, AI models had \"long since exceeded human biology experts with PhDs - with performance in chemistry quickly catching up\". 'Humans losing control' From novels such as Isaac Asimov's I, Robot to modern video games like Horizon: Zero Dawn, sci-fi has long imagined what would happen if AI broke free of human control. Now, according to the report, the \"worst-case scenario\" of humans losing control of advanced AI systems is \"taken seriously by many experts\". AI models are increasingly exhibiting some of the capabilities required to self-replicate across the internet, controlled lab tests suggested. AISI examined whether models could carry out simple versions of tasks needed in the early stages of self-replication - such as \"passing know-your customer checks required to access financial services\" in order to successfully purchase the computing on which their copies would run. But the research found to be able to do this in the real world, AI systems would need to complete several such actions in sequence \"while remaining undetected\", something its research suggests they currently lack the capacity to do. Institute experts also looked at the possibility of models \"sandbagging\" - or strategically hiding their true capabilities from testers. They found tests showed it was possible, but there was no evidence of this type of subterfuge taking place. In May, AI firm Anthropic released a controversial report which described how an AI model was capable of seemingly blackmail-like behaviour if it thought its \"self-preservation\" was threatened. The threat from rogue AI is, however, a source of profound disagreement among leading researchers - many of whom feel it is exaggerated . 'Universal jailbreaks' To mitigate the risk of their systems being used for nefarious purposes, companies deploy numerous safeguards. But researchers were able to find \"universal jailbreaks\" - or workarounds - for all the models studied which would allow them to dodge these protections. However, for some models, the time it took for experts to persuade systems to circumvent safeguards had increased forty-fold in just six months. The report also found an increase in the use of tools which allowed AI agents to perform \"high-stakes tasks\" in critical sectors such as finance. But researchers did not consider AI's potential to cause unemployment in the short-term by displacing human workers. The institute also did not examine the environmental impact of the computing resources required by advanced models, arguing that its task was to focus on \"societal impacts\" that are closely linked to AI's abilities rather than more \"diffuse\" economic or environmental effects. Some argue both are imminent and serious societal threats posed by the tech. And hours before the AISI report was published, a peer-reviewed study suggested the environmental impact could be greater than previously thought , and argued for more detailed data to be released by big tech.",

Notifications seen by some users based in the UK and US say they can only share a certain number of links in Facebook posts without a subscription - which starts at £9.99 per month. Meta has described it as \"a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value\" for subscribers. Social media expert Matt Navarra said it signifies the company's bid to monetise more areas of its platforms. \"This isn't really about verification as much as about bundling survival features behind a subscription,\" he told the BBC. Meta Verified offers Facebook and Instagram users a blue tick, \"enhanced\" account support and protection from impersonation. Mr Navarra said having already put a price on such features, the company now appeared to be doing the same for content distribution and \"the basic ability to send people\" to other parts of the internet. He was among those recently notified of Facebook's test - having received a notification saying from 16 December he would only be able to share two links a month in Facebook posts. \"If you're a creator or a business, I think the message is essentially if Facebook is a part of your growth or traffic strategy, that access now has a price tag attached to it,\" Mr Navarra told the BBC. \"And that's new in its explicitness, even if it's been the direction of travel for a while.\" 'Brutal reality' Alongside other social platforms such as LinkedIn, Meta has encouraged users to verify themselves as a way to unlock more features or engagement on its platforms. Elon Musk overhauled Twitter's verification scheme after he bought the platform in 2022 - with X's blue verified ticks reserved for those who pay, and giving holders a boosted presence in replies to posts and on its For You feed. This has proved controversial, with the EU fining it €120m (£105m) in December . Nonetheless, Mark Zuckerberg's company Meta rolled out a similar scheme shortly thereafter . It said it would also echo Musk's changes at X with a \"community notes\" tool for users to label misleading posts, after making cuts to moderation and fact checkers . Facebook told tech news publication TechCrunch its link-limiting test extended to a select group of users of its \"professional mode\" or Pages. The features are used by many creators and businesses to promote content on the platform and gain insights into how it has performed with users. \"For creators it reinforces a pretty brutal reality that Facebook is no longer a reliable traffic engine and Meta is increasingly nudging it away from people trying to use it as one,\" Mr Navarra said. He said it also served as a reminder that \"Meta will always optimise for Meta, first\". \"Tests like this underline why building a business that's overly dependent on any one platform's goodwill is incredibly risky,\" he said.",

Dame Rachel de Souza told the Press Association children were \"crying out\" for engagement with their relatives over the festive break, and urged them to have \"phone-free time\". Nearly half of parents with children aged 18 or younger plan to allow phones at the Christmas dinner table this year, according to a recent survey. \"I can't tell you how many children tell me about sitting at dinner and the parents are on the phone,\" Dame Rachel said. \"So this Christmas, let's turn them off.\" Research by More in Common for Yondr found nearly four in 10 adults say smartphones have disrupted their Christmas in some way. The children's commissioner said while she had been guilty of using her phone at meal times in the past, setting clear guidelines for everyone, not just children, was key. \"We have to lead as adults,\" Dame Rachel said. \"We can't talk about banning for the kids if we're not doing it ourselves.\" Her comments came as she launched a new guide offering tips for children's safety online and how to set boundaries for screen time. Pete Etchells, psychology professor at Bath Spa University, told BBC News Christmas is a good time to lean into conversations with children about developing healthy relationships with tech. \"It's not about feeling guilty or ashamed of our tech use, but noticing it more,\" he said. \"And striking up conversations about what we're happy with, and what we would like to be doing differently.\" The new guide by the commissioner, available online , has been released to support parents who \"may feel overwhelmed\" by \"mixed messages\" around online safety, and is informed by child focus groups. In it, parents can find \"practical tips\" and \"conversation starters\" on how to talk around topics such as managing screen time, dealing with negative online experiences, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI). Teenagers aged 13 to 18 told Dame Rachel they accepted bad things can happen online, feeling it was an inevitable part of the online world. They also shared how they had been contacted by strangers, seen pornography, and were aware of intimate images of their peers being shared. Dame Rachel said it was essential for parents to \"talk early and talk often\" with their children about their presence online. Arabella Skinner from Health Professionals for Safer Screens told BBC News simple rules can make a difference. She suggested creating a family plan around device use, or designing a box to store mobiles during meals. \"Children feel most secure and content when they have our full attention, eye contact, and presence,\" she said. \"It is so important that we, as adults, spend time with our children and not always looking at screens.\" A report published by the regulator Ofcom earlier this month highlighted concerns children had over the negative impacts of endless screentime and \"brain rot\". It found that children aged between eight and 14 are spending an average of nearly three hours online each day, and that up to a quarter of that time was between 2100 and 0500.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Fifa will finally release its much-anticipated return to video games in 2026, several years after its acrimonious split with developer EA. But it is Netflix, rather than a major game studio, which has secured the rights to the upcoming football game. Once one of the most profitable brands in gaming history, issues including a costly licence prompted Fifa's previous publisher Electronic Arts to stop using the name in 2023 - instead naming its best-selling game EA Sports FC. Netflix said the new Fifa would be developed and published by Delphi Interactive - which has yet to release a video game - and released ahead of the 2026 World Cup. It said subscribers will be able to play online via the Netflix app on iOS and Android devices - or on select TVs by using their phone as the controller. EA Sports released the first Fifa game in 1993, and ran the franchise for 30 years until moving away from the branding to create its own. The series was estimated to have around 150 million players. But the renamed game still connected with fans - with EA FC 24 being the best-selling game in the UK in 2023 . Fifa president Gianni Infantino said the football governing body was \"very excited\" to team up with Netflix Games ahead of the World Cup in 2026. \"Our reimagined game truly marks the beginning of a new era of digital football,\" he said. \"It will be available for free to Netflix members and is a great historic step for Fifa.\" California-based Delphi Interactive, the studio behind the game, is also working in partnership with IO Interactive on a new James Bond title, 007: First Light. The firm's boss Casper Daugaard said as \"lifelong Fifa fans\" it wanted to make the game \"the most fun, approachable, and global football game ever created\". Reaction to the announcement has so far been mixed, with some fans questioning whether the mobile-first focus from Netflix was the way forward for the franchise. \"FIFA should never have left EA,\" said one person on social media site X .",

      "summary_tr_long": "Downing Street insists negotiations over US-UK tech deal still live Liv McMahon Technology reporter Reuters Downing Street says the UK remains in \"active conversations with US counterparts at all levels of government\" about a wide-ranging tech deal. The BBC understands talks over the Technology Prosperity Deal have stalled because of US concerns about what it considers to be wider UK trade barriers. Billed as \"historic\" when it was unveiled during US President Donald Trump's state visit in September, the partnership saw both countries pledge to co-operate further in areas such as AI and quantum computing. \"We're confident of securing a deal that will shape the future of millions on both sides of the Atlantic,\" the Prime Minister's official spokesman said. He said he would not comment directly on what were \"live\" discussions but added \"negotiations of this kind are never straightforward\". The New York Times - which first reported the story - said there were \"broader disagreements\" between the two sides, including over digital regulations and food safety rules. The UK government did not comment on these specific claims. The White House has not responded to the BBC's request for a comment. However, Trump's science adviser Michael Kratsios on Tuesday evening said the administration hoped to restart talks over the deal. \"In line with Section III of the US-UK Technology Prosperity Deal, we hope to resume work with the United Kingdom once the UK has made substantial progress in implementing its commitments under the Economic Prosperity Deal,\" Kratsios wrote on X. \"We look forward to continuing our productive collaboration across AI, quantum, nuclear, and other critical technology areas under the Deal.\" When the deal was announced the government was keen to highlight the benefits it said it would bring. \"This Tech Prosperity Deal marks a generational step change in our relationship with the US,\" Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said in a statement. Technology secretary Liz Kendall said the partnership would \"transform lives across Britain\" and was a \"vote of confidence in Britain's booming AI sector.\" At the same time the deal was revealed, a series of US tech firms announced a flurry of investment in the UK. A total of £31bn in planned spending was set out by tech giants including Microsoft, Nvidia and Google. It is believed those investment plans are unaffected. Google, Microsoft and Nvidia have also been approached for comment, but the firms have not yet responded to the BBC. Nvidia boss Jensen Huang said in September his company's UK investment reflected his belief it could become an \"AI superpower\" - an ambition championed by Sir Keir's government. It said investment announced by tech firms alongside the Tech Prosperity Deal would be used to scale-up AI infrastructure such as data centres, across the UK. 'Piecemeal approach' The tech pact was documented in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which said both countries would seek to collaborate across AI, quantum computing and nuclear power. It said this could include working together to build \"powerful quantum machines,\" support innovation in AI hardware and explore potential new ways to use advanced nuclear energy. But the MOU also states any proposals are not binding and that it only \"becomes operative alongside substantive progress being made to formalise and implement\" the wider US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal, signed in May. The Trump administration has sought to rewrite the global rules on trade, imposing tariffs on many countries - including traditional allies like the UK - and seeking new deals which it argues are fairer to the US. For the UK that has meant haggling over various sectors of the economy, a process which has yielded agreements on cars and more recently, pharmaceuticals . However, a proposed deal to eliminate tariffs on UK steel exports to the US has been put on hold indefinitely, the BBC understands. Allie Renison, director of communications firm SEC Newgate UK and a former government trade adviser, said the current impasse over tech reflected the US and UK's \"slightly piecemeal approach\" to inking trade deals. \"Instead of having everything done at once, different areas are being linked to different parts,\" she told the BBC - noting how concerns about separate trade areas may now be affecting tech agreements. While questions hung over what the potential roadblocks could mean for US tech firms' pledged investments in the UK, Ms Renison added, it was unlikely to be little more than \"a bit of posturing in the wider negotiations\".

Led by technology secretary Liz Kendall, it will see female leaders from tech companies and organisations advise the government on how to boost diversity and economic growth in the industry. BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, recently suggested women accounted for only 22% of those working in IT specialist roles in the UK. Ms Kendall said the Women in Tech group would \"break down the barriers that still hold too many people back\". \"When women are inspired to take on a role in tech and have a seat at the table, the sector can make more representative decisions, build products that serve everyone,\" she said. BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, warned in December the amount of women working in the UK tech sector still lagged far behind men. It said the government should look to help close the gender gap in order to meet its ambitious AI goals . \"We cannot create high-trust, high-integrity AI systems if the profession behind them is missing out on the talents and perspective of half the population,\" said chief executive Sharron Gunn.

Dr Imafidon, who passed A-level computing aged 11 and received a Master's Degree in Maths and Computer Science from the University of Oxford aged 20, has sought to encourage more young women into careers in Stem - science, technology, engineering and maths. She told the BBC her role would build on more than a decade of work to establish greater equality for - and representation of - women. But now, amid what she called \"a fourth industrial revolution\", was a key moment to \"be part of shifting who is making those decisions for what comes next\". \"This isn't just about having women being the driving force and building the technology, but this is about building technology that benefits everybody,\" she said. 'Equality long overdue' The government said the taskforce will advise on ways to make the tech sector more representative and \"ensure the UK accesses the full talent pool, market opportunities, and innovation capacity needed for economic growth\".

Thousands of Three customers reported they were unable to make calls in June , while BT and EE customers were hit by a similar outage in July . The regulator said it would examine whether the mobile networks did not do enough to prevent the problems. Three said in a statement it was engaging with Ofcom. A BT Group spokesperson apologised to customers who had been affected. \"We will co-operate fully with Ofcom throughout the investigation and apologise again for any issues caused by this incident,\" they said. Meanwhile, Three said it had \"experienced disruption to voice services following an exceptional spike in network traffic triggered by a third-party software configuration change\". \"Since the outage, we have engaged openly with Ofcom and will continue to cooperate fully with their investigation,\" it said. According to Ofcom, firms must take proper action to identify risks and prepare for \"anything that compromises the availability, performance or functionality of their network or service\". It said providers must also prevent \"adverse effects arising from any such compromises\" - saying where this happens, they must take steps to mitigate them. \"The importance of connectivity cannot be underestimated,\" said telecoms analyst Paolo Pescatore. \"We all demand a robust and reliable connection at home and out and about.\" He said outages can occur despite \"significant efforts\" to prevent them - but said there must be \"a straightforward process to identify the issue and to learn lessons so it does not happen again\". Previous problems The incidents at the heart of Ofcom's investigation saw thousands of customers across BT and Three networks report problems with their mobile service. At the time, Three told customers complaining of issues making and receiving calls on 25 June it was experiencing \"an issue affecting voice services\". This was not isolated to its own network - it also caused problems for customers on networks that piggyback off of Three, such as ID Mobile. A month later, EE and BT customers complained of similar issues. A government spokesperson said at the time \"communications providers have statutory obligations to ensure their networks and services are appropriately resilient\". Operators have previously faced scrutiny over outages or issues affecting peoples' ability to make calls or contact emergency services. BT was fined £17.5m in July 2024 for a \"catastrophic failure\" of its emergency call handling service which led to thousands of 999 calls not being connected. Three was ordered to pay £1.9m in 2017 after Ofcom found it could have prevented an issue that caused a loss of service for customers a year prior. It has since merged with Vodafone to form the UK's biggest mobile network, with 27 million customers.",

      "summary_tr_long": "The US firm behind the Roomba smart vacuum cleaner, iRobot, has filed for bankruptcy protection after facing competition from Chinese rivals and being hit by tariffs. Under the so-called pre-packaged Chapter 11 process , the main manufacturer of its devices, Shenzhen-based Picea Robotics, will take ownership of the firm. The tough commercial landscape had forced iRobot to cut its prices and make major investments in new technology, according to documents filed on Sunday. US import duties of 46% on goods from Vietnam, where most of iRobot's devices for the American market are made, increased its costs by $23m (£17.2m) this year, the firm said. The loss-making company was valued at $3.56bn in 2021 after the pandemic helped to drive strong demand for its products. On Friday, iRobot's shares fell by more than 13% on the technology-heavy Nasdaq trading platform in New York. iRobot said the bankruptcy filing was not expected to disrupt its app, supply chains or product support. Founded in 1990 by three members of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Artificial Intelligence Lab, iRobot initially focused on defence and space technology before launching the Roomba in 2002. The Roomba holds about 42% of the US market share and 65% of the Japanese market share for robotic vacuum cleaners, according to the company. Last year, a planned $1.7bn takeover deal by online retail giant Amazon was derailed by the European Union 's competition watchdog. Trade tariffs imposed by US Donald Trump on goods entering America from overseas has added to costs to many businesses, including iRobot, which rely on imports for product manufacturing. Trump has argued that the import taxes will boost American jobs and industry. Picea is a manufacturer of robotic vacuum cleaners, with research and development and production facilities in China and Vietnam. It has more than 7,000 employees worldwide and has sold more than 20 million robotic vacuum cleaners.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Grand Theft Auto game creator sacked us for trying to unionise Hope Webb BBC Scotland reporter BBC The workers have been protesting outside the firm's headquarters in Edinburgh and London Former staff at the firm behind Grand Theft Auto have told the BBC that a \"devastating\" mass sacking took place allegedly because they tried to unionise. Some 31 employees were dismissed in October for what Rockstar North called \"gross misconduct\". The majority were based at the gaming giant's Edinburgh headquarters, with former workers claiming they were penalised for discussing working conditions in a private online forum. Rockstar North said it was incorrect to suggest the dismissals were linked to union membership or activities. It said it took action after staff discussed confidential information, including specific game features from upcoming titles, in a public forum. The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) called it a \"ruthless act of union-busting\". Rockstar North is one of the UK's largest game developers. Its upcoming GTA 6 game is expected to be one of the best-selling games of all time when it is released in November 2026. Information about game development is tightly controlled across the gaming industry, with employees often signing legally binding agreements not to share confidential information. A group of workers have been routinely protesting outside Rockstar North's Edinburgh and London offices. BBC Scotland News has now spoken to three of the dismissed Edinburgh workers accused of disclosing company information. Jordan Garland said staff wanted to unionise to improve the workplace Jordan Garland, a former senior production co-ordinator, said many staff members wanted to unionise because \"we were so passionate about the industry and that workplace in particular\". \"We just saw it as something we could do to make it better for everyone,\" he added. \"So it's a little bit devastating because it's an industry that I love, and I think we all love. We couldn't really see ourselves anywhere else.\" 'Sleepless nights' He said members of staff were discussing working conditions at the firm in a private digital forum. Jordan added: \"We were talking about working conditions, policy - not talking about projects or anything like that, just talking about conditions. \"That to me that feels like an essential, necessary part of organising. How can you organise a workplace if you can't talk about the conditions there?\" Jordan has worked at the company for 11 years and believes he was the first employee to be dismissed on the morning of 30 October. \"The first week was definitely difficult,\" he said. \"It was a lot of sleepless nights, a lot of tossing and turning about this. \"But in a kind of macabre way, it's good they fired so many people because there is this really strong community element now.\" Jamie Trimmer worked at Rockstar North for about 18 years before he was sacked Designer Jamie Trimmer worked in the gaming industry for most of his adult life before being sacked from Rockstar North. \"I've worked there, like, 18 years now,\" he said. \"I think I'm the longest serving person that was fired. \"It's all I know really, and then it's just sort of ripped away. I'm left not knowing what to do next really. \"I never would have expected they would hit the nuclear option of firing so many of us in one go. It does highlight the need for unions.\" 'Deeply concerning' The group, along with fellow dismissed colleagues, are now hoping to take Rockstar North to an employment tribunal. However, they may have to wait up to a year for their case to be heard. In the meantime, they are waiting to learn if they qualify for an intermediate relief hearing, which could see them reinstated in their roles or kept on Rockstar North's payroll. The issue was also raised at Prime Minister's Questions in Westminster last week by MP Chris Murray. Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"deeply concerning\" and promised to look into the issue. He added: \"Every worker has the right to join a trade union, and we're determined to strengthen workers' rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union.\" Sarah Blackburn said she appreciated the support after she lost her job at Rockstar North Sacked production co-ordinator Sarah Blackburn said the public and political support has helped her deal with the situation. \"It's massively heartening to hear actually and in a way, I'd say validating,\" she said. \"We've had a lot of support coming from places that I genuinely didn't expect. \"We've had people who were in unions who previously fought fights in different industries basically just expressing solidarity and support. It's a flex of power and it's been painful to be on this side of it, but I think the support has been great.\" In a statement, Rockstar North told BBC Scotland News: \"Rockstar Games took action against a small group of individuals, across the UK and internationally, who distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations. \"Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading.\"",

      "summary_tr_long": "A billionaire investor keen on buying TikTok's US operations has told the BBC he has been left in limbo as the latest deadline for the app's sale looms. The US has repeatedly delayed the date by which the platform's Chinese owner, ByteDance, must sell or be blocked for American users. US President Donald Trump initially gave himself until December 16 to comply with the law before moving the deadline to 23 January 2026 with a new executive order. \"We're just standing by and waiting to see what happens,\" investor Frank McCourt told BBC News. \"But if the moment arrives, we're prepared to move forward... we've raised the capital to buy it - we'll see.\" The popular short-form video app was due to be banned or sold in the US in January in accordance with a law passed by Congress in 2024. Lawmakers said at the time ByteDance's links to the Chinese government threatened national security, and expressed fears Beijing could force the company to hand over data on US users. It's a concern TikTok and its owners have always said is unfounded. The law was signed by President Joe Biden while he was still in office and was upheld by the Supreme Court in early 2025. Trump and members of his administration have previously claimed a TikTok deal was done , and had the blessing of Chinese President Xi Jinping. The president has also said \"sophisticated\" US investors would be involved in acquiring the app , including two of his allies: Oracle chairman Larry Ellison and Dell Technologies' Michael Dell. Members of the Trump administration had indicated the deal would be formalised in a meeting between Trump and Xi in October - however it concluded without an agreement being reached. Neither TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance nor Beijing have since announced approval of a sale, despite Trump's claims. When Trump signed his most recent executive order extending the deadline to January, he said in an online post it would lead to a deal being completed. Without naming Trump's hand-selected investors, Mr McCourt told the BBC he was concerned \"about a concentration of power and influence because platforms like TikTok are very influencing\". He is part of a group of investors including Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and Canadian investor Kevin O'Leary. \"My hope would be that whatever happens, that it is shut down or sold, and lands in the hands of people that comply with the law,\" he said. He said he wants to operate TikTok without any of its Chinese technology, including its powerful recommendation algorithm, and that his Project Liberty has developed other technology that could be used instead.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Online gaming escaped Australia's social media ban - but critics say it's just as addictive Katy Watson Australia correspondent , Perth Getty Images Critics say gaming platforms should be included in Australia's ban on social media for under-16s Wednesday afternoons have become a ritual for 15-year-old Sadmir Perviz. Sadmir and his board game companions are just some of the 300 patients at the gaming disorder clinic, Australia's only publicly-run institution of its type, helping patients wean themselves off excessive online gaming habits. It's a bit of a departure for the 15-year-old who until a couple of months ago preferred to play games with friends online for 10 hours a day. You can interact with people, so you actually know who's there rather than just being on a call with random people.\" Dr Daniela Vecchio, the psychiatrist who set up the clinic, says that while gaming isn't bad in itself, it can become a problem - an addiction even. So, she wonders why gaming platforms have not been included in Australia's \"world-first\" social media ban for under-16s. The ban, which came into force on Wednesday, is supposed to prevent teens from having accounts on 10 social media platforms including Instagram, Snapchat and X. \"The individual who plays games for excessive amounts of time also spends excessive amounts of time on social media platforms where they can see other gamers or can live stream gaming, so it's a way to connect.\" Dr Daniela Vecchio runs Australia's only publicly funded clinic for gaming disorder clinic Sadmir, for example, spent much of his time on the gaming platform Steam, as well as YouTube. Dr Vecchio singles out the platforms Discord and Roblox as particular worries - a concern echoed by many experts and parents the BBC has spoken to in covering the ban and its impact. Both Roblox and Discord have been dogged by claims that some children are being exposed to explicit or harmful content through them and are facing lawsuits relating to child safety in the US. The 'wild west of internet usage' Former gaming clinic patient Kevin Koo, 35, wonders whether a social media ban could have influenced the access he got at a younger age. So I think that for me, the damage has already been done.\" A former quantum finance intern interested in AI, Mr Koo lost his job just before the pandemic. Dr Vecchio agrees with the comparison - if she had her way, she'd be tempted not just to expand the social media ban to gaming but to raise the age to 18. Gaming disorder is also now recognised by the World Health Organisation as an official diagnosis and, according to a 2022 Macquarie University study, around 2.8% of Australian children are affected by it. Kevin Koo, 35, wonders whether he might have benefited from a social media ban The Australian government says its ban is about protecting kids from harmful content, cyberbullying, online grooming and \"predatory algorithms\" among other things – some or all of which could arguably be said to exist with gaming platforms. Instead, platforms have been selected according to three criteria: whether the platform's sole or \"significant purpose\" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users; whether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and whether it allows users to post. in 60 seconds Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University and chief investigator at the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Digital Child, says the ban on social media is too blunt a tool – instead a more nuanced approach is needed, including towards gaming platforms. \"There is such a wide spectrum of gaming from incredibly positive, nurturing, fun, creative, expressive spaces - something like Minecraft comes to mind where it's had so many positive uses.\" However, platforms like Roblox are at the other end of the spectrum, he says. And we know that some of the games that have been made that clearly feel like they're meant for adults have been accessed by very young people.\" On Professor Leaver's desk at the university are three plushies with inbuilt ChatGPT inside them. \"I do think we're at a moment, and it's not just Australia, you look across the EU, there is huge appetite for all sorts of regulation.\" A treatment plan, not a cure In Mr Koo's case, for example, his vice wasn't just gaming. It was AI chatbots, another feature of online life that has come under scrutiny for everything from making things up to allegedly encouraging children to kill themselves . There is evidence they are designed to manipulate users into prolonging interactions and their use has even given rise to a new phenomenon called AI psychosis , in which people increasingly rely on AI chatbots and then become convinced that something imaginary has become real. Mr Koo also started googling his mental health issues and relying on AI to help confirm his diagnoses. \"I do think being able to read human emotions and having that face-to-face conversation with someone is completely different.\" The government has said it will continually review the list of banned platforms and at the end of November added Twitch, a streaming platform where people typically play video games while chatting to viewers. Communications Minister Anika Wells also told the BBC last week that the eSafety Commissioner \"definitely has her eye on Roblox\". \"Children need to be protected, they need to be safeguarded.\" Update 15 December: This article has been amended to remove a contributor for editorial reasons.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Amazon has pulled a video recap made with artificial intelligence (AI) from its hit TV show Fallout after users said it got several facts wrong about the series. The firm said in November it was testing the \"first-of-its-kind\" tool in the US to help viewers catch up on some of its shows on streaming service Prime Video - including Fallout, its adaptation of the popular video game franchise. But it has since disappeared from the site after users highlighted mistakes in its video summarising the events of Fallout season one - including claiming one scene was set more than 100 years earlier than it was. The BBC has approached Amazon for comment. The move to apparently press pause on its AI-powered recaps was first reported by tech publication The Verge . Amazon said in November the recaps would be available to users as an experimental feature, and only \"for select English-language Prime Original series in the US\". \"Video Recaps use AI to summarise a show's most pertinent plot points with a theatrical-quality video that includes narration, dialogue, and music,\" it said . But fans eagerly awaiting the release of the next series of Fallout on 17 December highlighted errors introduced in its video recap for its first series. Users on Reddit said a clip showing The Ghoul - one of the show's central characters, played by actor Walton Goggins - was wrongly described in the AI narration as a \"1950s flashback\". Despite the clip's retro aesthetic, it actually depicts a scene in 2077 - something fans of the series would know instantly. Fans also said the recap incorrectly summarised a scene between The Ghoul and protagonist Lucy MacLean, played by Ella Purnell, altering their dynamic in a way that would confuse new viewers. It joins a long list of errors have being introduced when using generative AI tools to produce content summaries. In early 2025, Apple suspended an AI feature summarising notifications after it drew complaints for repeated mistakes in its summaries of news headlines. The BBC was among the groups to complain about the feature , after an alert generated by Apple's AI falsely told some readers Luigi Mangione, who has been charged in the US with killing UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson, had shot himself. Google's AI Overviews, which aim to provide concise summaries of search results, have also come under criticism and mockery for errors .",

      "summary_tr_long": "Creative industries 'incredibly worried' about OpenAI-Disney deal Shiona McCallum Senior technology reporter Alamy A union representing workers in the creative industries says there is \"real concern\" among its members about a $1bn (£740m) deal which will see Disney characters brought to ChatGPT and video-generation tool Sora. It is the first major studio to license parts of its catalogue to OpenAI, which makes the tools. Fans will be able to generate and share pictures and videos of more than 200 characters from Disney's franchises, including Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars. \"Everyone in the entertainment industry, especially all the creative talent, are incredibly worried about what the implications are,\" said Sag-Aftra executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland. He said the two companies had contacted the union - which represents 170,000 media professionals worldwide - to say the agreement specifically rules out the use of the image, likeness or voice of human performers. But he said it was still a worrying development. \"There's real concern because nobody wants to see human creativity given away to AI models,\" he told BBC News. 'An important moment for our industry' The move comes as OpenAI faces mounting questions about how its rapidly advancing tech is used - and as anxiety in Hollywood increases over the impact of AI on the creative industries. According to a blog post announcing the news, the list of eligible characters include those from Disney films Zootopia, Moana and Encanto - as well as characters like Star Wars' Luke Skywalker and Marvel's Deadpool. It, of course, also includes Mickey and Minnie Mouse. But quite how the characters will sound remains unclear, as Disney said the agreement \"does not include any talent likenesses or voices\". \"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry,\" Disney boss Bob Iger said. \"Through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling.\" People are expected to be able to begin making the videos and images in Sora and ChatGPT in early 2026. The deal comes amid reports Disney lawyers sent Google a cease-and-desist letter on Wednesday accusing the tech firm of infringing its copyrights \"on a massive scale\". The BBC has asked Google for a response. Joel Smith, intellectual property partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons, said Disney's OpenAI deal showed \"rights owners and major AI developers are moving fast to strike collaborative licensing deals to access content for training and future use\". Equity, the entertainment trade union, says actors' rights need to be protected. The group is currently balloting thousands of performers asking if they are willing to refuse being digitally scanned on set to push for stronger AI safeguards. Cathy Sweet, Equity's head of TV and Film, said the deal between Disney and OpenAI reinforced \"exactly why our members are fighting for AI protections\". \"The recorded material that will be sold on as part of this eye-watering big money deal are the result of creatives' professional work, and their rights must be protected,\" she said. Content concerns Sora's hyper-realistic videos have proven to be popular in the US, but there have been significant criticisms from those claiming it has also led to some people creating offensive deepfakes of dead public figures. In October, OpenAI paused the video tool's ability to generate images of Dr Martin Luther King Jr after the app produced \"disrespectful\" depictions of the civil rights leader. The firm acknowledged the need for stronger safeguards after clips emerged showing him saying offensive things, prompting a public outcry. Other similar videos of President John F. Kennedy, Queen Elizabeth II and physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking also circulated widely. In some cases, family members called on OpenAI to stop allowing videos to be made. Zelda Williams, daughter of the late comedian Robin Williams, urged people to stop sending her AI-generated videos of her father. In November, Warner Music Group announced plans to launch an AI music venture with technology start-up Suno , a year after it sued the firm in a landmark case.",

The French-developed role-playing game (RPG) cleaned up in nine of the 10 categories it was up for, with further wins in best narrative, best music and best performance. It fended off competition from Death Stranding 2, Nintendo platformer Donkey Kong Bananza, indie games Hollow Knight: Silksong and Hades 2, and medieval adventure Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 to claim the top prize. During the ceremony in Los Angeles, players also got their first glimpses of two new Tomb Raider games, sequel Control Resonant and a new Star Wars role-playing game. Clair Obscur is set in a world where a supernatural being known as The Paintress prevents the population from growing past a certain age. The game, which tells the story of a group of adventurers on a quest to destroy The Paintress, was praised for its emotional narrative and use of old-school, turn-based battles. Players were also won over by the story of developer Sandfall Interactive, formed by a group of employees who left gaming giant Ubisoft to make their dream project . Accepting the game of the year award, director Guillaume Broche - wearing a red beret and striped t-shirt in a nod to the game's strong French identity - said the year had been a \"weird timeline\" for the studio as he thanked his team. He also extended thanks to the \"unsung heroes\" of the industry - \"the people who make tutorials on YouTube on how to make a game, because we had no idea how to make one before\". AFP via Getty Images Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's director Guillaume Broche accepted the game of the year prize Clair Obscur was the hot favourite going into the awards, and the most-nominated game in the ceremony's history with a total of 12 nods. It was the debut project for the musician, who was discovered after he posted a collection of homemade video game music to his SoundCloud account. Three of its nominations were in a single category - best performance - and actress Jennifer English claimed the prize over co-stars Charlie Cox and Ben Starr for her role as Maelle. The actress, who has often spoken about having ADHD, dedicated the award \"to every neurodivergent person watching\". Getty Images Jennifer English has appeared in three game of the year-winning titles, including Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3 Clair Obscur only missed out on two awards it was up for. Battlefield 6 won best audio design, while open-world action RPG Wuthering Waves was a surprising winner in the fan-voted Player's Voice category. Sequel Hollow Knight: Silksong was named best action-adventure, while anime-inspired horse racing game Umamusume: Pretty Derby was named best mobile game. The non-profit group encourages girls and young women to pursue careers in video games, and runs summer camps to teach programming and design skills. Stranger Things star David Harbour took to the stage to announce a new Total War: Warhammer 40K strategy game, and US singer Lenny Kravitz officially revealed his villainous role in the upcoming James Bond game 007: First Light. Team Cherry Hollow Knight: Silksong, one of the year's most anticipated games, was named best action-adventure Despite being referred to as the \"Oscars of gaming\", the Game Awards, hosted by its founder Geoff Keighley, is a mixture of traditional ceremony and trailer showcase. Some of the games industry's biggest developers will give the first look at upcoming major titles during the show, and it's thought that this is one of the main reasons many fans tune in. One of the night's biggest announcements was RPG Divinity from Larian Studios, the maker of 2023 game of the year Baldur's Gate 3. A remake of the original Tomb Raider game had also been leaked, but the announcement of a second, brand new entry starring Lara Croft came as a surprise. Star Wars fans got a glimpse at two new games - Fate of the Old Republic, a long-awaited successor to 2004's beloved Knights of the Old Republic, and Galactic Racer, developed by UK-based studio Fuse Games. The cast of the new Street Fighter movie adaptation, with the exception of rapper 50 Cent, introduced its first trailer. And fans also saw new footage from the upcoming Resident Evil 9, confirming the appearance of fan-favourite character Leon Kennedy, and PS5 shooter Saros. Donkey Kong Bananza was named best Family Game The Game Awards has been criticised in the past for prioritising advertising over awards, with winning speeches being cut short and on-stage presentations being absent in some categories. There was praise of 2024's show for going some way to address criticisms, but developers have continued to call on organiser Geoff Keighley to better acknowledge problems in the industry, such as the high number of job losses in recent years. This year, there have been complaints about the awards abandoning its Future Class scheme - an initiative founded in 2020 to highlight \"rising stars\" in video games. It was last run in 2023, when current and former members of the group signed an open letter urging the awards to address the Israel-Gaza war. In the run-up to this year's nominations, after it was confirmed Future Class would not return, alumni accused the scheme of tokenism and not doing enough to help them build contacts. BBC Newsbeat has approached organisers for comment. Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here .",

While the US currently has no national laws regulating AI, more than 1,000 separate AI bills have been introduced in states across the US, according to the White House.

      "summary_tr_long": "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at blocking states from enforcing their own artificial intelligence (AI) regulations. \"We want to have one central source of approval,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. It will give the Trump administration tools to push back on the most \"onerous\" state rules, said White House AI adviser David Sacks. The government will not oppose AI regulations around children's safety, he added. The move marks a win for technology giants who have called for US-wide AI legislation as it could have a major impact on America's goal of leading the fast-developing industry. AI company bosses have argued that state-level regulations could slow innovation and hinder the US in its race against China to dominate the industry, as firms pour billions of dollars into the technology. But the move to pre-empt state laws has drawn opposition. While the US currently has no national laws regulating AI, more than 1,000 separate AI bills have been introduced in states across the US, according to the White House. This year alone, 38 states including California, home to many of the world's biggest technology companies, have adopted some 100 AI regulations, the National Conference of State Legislatures says. One in California requires platforms to regularly remind users they are interacting with a chatbot, in a bid to protect children and teens from potential harms. The state also passed a bill requiring the largest AI developers to lay out plans to limit potential catastrophic risks stemming from their AI models. In North Dakota, a new law would prevent people from using AI-powered robots to stalk or harass others, while Arkansas bars AI content from infringing on intellectual property rights or existing copyright. Oregon brought in a law prohibiting a \"non-human entity\" including one powered by AI from using licenced medical titles, such as registered nurse. Critics of Trump's executive order have argued that state rules are necessary in the absence of meaningful guardrails at the federal level. \"Stripping states from enacting their own AI safeguards undermines states' basic rights to establish sufficient guardrails to protect their residents,\" said Julie Scelfo, from advocacy group Mothers Against Media Addiction in a statement. California's Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and vocal critic of the president, accused Trump of bowing to the interests of tech allies with the executive order. \"Today, President Trump continued his ongoing grift in the White House, attempting to enrich himself and his associates, with a new executive order seeking to preempt state laws protecting Americans from unregulated AI technology,\" he said. AI firms OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the order. But the move drew praise from tech lobby group NetChoice. \"We look forward to working with the White House and Congress to set nationwide standards and a clear rulebook for innovators,\" said its director of policy Patrick Hedger. Michael Goodyear, an associate professor at New York Law School, said the AI industry was rightly alarmed about having to comply with a patchwork of rules, which might conflict. \"It would be better to have one federal law than a bunch of conflicting state laws,\" he said. But, he added: \"That assumes that we will have a good federal law in place.\"",

      "summary_tr_long": "Google asks UK experts to find uses for its powerful quantum tech Chris Vallance Senior technology reporter Google Google's quantum chip which the firm dubbed Willow Google has announced plans to team up with the UK to invite researchers to come up with uses for the tech giant's state-of-the-art quantum chip Willow. It is one of several firms competing to develop a powerful quantum computer - which is seen as an exciting new frontier in the future of computing. Researchers hope they will be able to crack problems in fields such as chemistry and medicine which are impossible for current computers to solve. Professor Paul Stevenson of the University of Surrey - who had no involvement with the agreement - told the BBC it was \"great news for UK researchers\". The collaboration between Google and the UK's national lab for quantum computing means more researchers will get access to the technology. \"The new ability to access Google's Willow processor, through open competition, puts UK researchers in an enviable position,\" said Prof Stevenson. \"It is good news for Google, too, who will benefit from the skills of UK academics.\" Quantum devices work in a fundamentally different way to the computers powering our smartphones and laptops, solving problems using technologies based on the science of particle physics But the full potential of the technology has yet to be realised and the machines that currently exist have few practical applications and most are experimental. It is hoped giving UK researchers access to Willow would help \"uncover new real world applications\". Scientists will be able to submit proposals describing how they intend to use the chip, and they will work with experts from Google and the UK quantum lab to design and conduct experiments. Quantum competition When it was unveiled in 2024, Google's Willow chip was seen as a significant step forward in the field. Rival firms including Amazon and IBM are also developing their own tech. The UK has a significant quantum industry. Quantinuum, which has headquarters in Cambridge and Colorado, US, reached a $10bn (£7.45bn) valuation in September. Announcements of new developments from firms throughout 2025 have led some experts to believe powerful machines capable of having real-world impact will be developed within a decade. Dr Michael Cuthbert, Director at the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC) said the partnership would \"accelerate discovery\". He said the cutting edge science it would support could ultimately lead to quantum computing being used in areas such as \"life science, materials, chemistry, and fundamental physics\". The NQCC already hosts seven quantum computers from British-based firms such as Quantum Motion, ORCA and Oxford Ionics. The government says it is committing £670m to support the tech, which is a priority area in the UK's Industrial Strategy. Officials believe quantum could contribute £11 billion to the UK economy by 2045.",

Do Kwon, a South Korean national, was co-founder of Singapore-based Terraform Labs, which developed the TerraUSD and Luna digital coins. Kwon had admitted misleading investors about TerraUSD, a so-called stablecoin that was supposed to maintain its value against the US dollar. He was one of a number of crypto bosses to face charges in the US after digital tokens slumped in 2022, triggering the failure of several companies. US District Judge Paul A Engelmayer, who handed down the sentence, said the Stanford graduate had repeatedly lied to investors who trusted him with their money. \"This was a fraud on an epic, generational scale,\" he said during Thursday's court hearing in Manhattan. \"In the history of federal prosecutions, there are few frauds that have caused as much harm as you have.\" Kwon - who pleaded guilty in August to conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud - expressed remorse to the judge. \"I have spent almost every waking moment of the last few years thinking of what I could have done different and what I can do now to make things right,\" he said. Prosecutors alleged that when TerraUSD fell below its $1 peg in May 2021, Kwon told investors that a computer algorithm had restored its value. Instead, Kwon had arranged for a trading firm to secretly buy millions of dollars of the coin to artificially boost its value, according to court documents.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Reddit has launched a challenge in Australia's highest court against the nation's landmark social media ban for children. The online forum is among 10 social media platforms which must bar Australians aged under 16 from having accounts, under a new law which began on Wednesday. The ban, which is being watched closely around the world, was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms. Reddit is complying with the ban, but in its case will argue that the policy has serious implications for privacy and political rights. It is the second such legal challenge, with two Australian teens also awaiting a High Court hearing. \"Despite the best intentions, this law is missing the mark,\" Reddit said in an update on its website. \"There are more effective ways for the Australian government to accomplish our shared goal of protecting youth.\" Australia's Communications Minister Anika Wells has previously said the government will not be swayed by legal threats. \"We will not be intimidated by big tech. On behalf of Australian parents, we will stand firm,\" she told parliament after news of the first legal challenge broke last month. In that case, which the High Court has agreed to consider at an as-yet undecided date next year, two 15-year-olds from New South Wales are claiming the social media ban is unconstitutional as it infringes \"the implied freedom of communication on governmental and political matters\". \"Democracy doesn't start at 16 as this law says it will,\" Macey Newland told the BBC after their case was filed. The ban, which has excited global leaders and worried tech companies, has also been criticised by some who argue blanket prohibition is neither practical nor wise. Experts fear kids are going to circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that's performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather. And backed by some mental health advocates, many children have argued it robs young people of connection - particularly those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities - and will leave them less equipped to tackle the realities of life on the web. But the policy is wildly popular with parents and has won the support of people like talk show host Oprah Winfrey, and Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. In a statement on their website, the pair lauded the \"bold\" action from Australia but said \"it shouldn't have come to this\". \"We hope this ban is only the start of a reckoning between society and the tech companies that built these platforms with growth as their first principle instead of safety.\" Various governments, from the US state of Florida to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest. Reddit said the law forces \"intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors\", isolates teens engaging in \"age-appropriate community experiences\" and creates an \"illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren't\". \"There are more targeted, privacy-preserving measures to protect young people online without resorting to blanket bans.\" The case is not \"an attempt to avoid compliance\" or \"an effort to retain young users for business reasons\", it added. \"Unlike other platforms included under this law, the vast majority of Redditors are adults, we don't market or target advertising to children under 18,\" it said. The other platforms affected by the ban include Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok.",

Instead, the magazine has recognised the year's most influential figure as \"the architects\" of artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia boss Jensen Huang, Meta head Mark Zuckerberg, X owner Elon Musk and AI \"godmother\" Fei-Fei Li are among those depicted on one of the magazine's two covers. Experts say it highlights how quickly AI, and the firms behind it, are reshaping society. It comes as a boom in the technology, ushered in by OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, continues at pace. Its boss Sam Altman said in September its chatbot is used by around 800 million people every week. Big tech firms are pouring billions of dollars into AI and the infrastructure behind it in a bid to stay ahead of rivals. There are two covers this year - one a piece of art depicting the letters AI surrounded by workers, and another a painting focused on the tech leaders themselves. Time The cover references the classic New York photograph \"Lunch atop a Skyscraper\" - but with tech figures in place of ironworkers At Meta, Zuckerberg has reportedly focused the firm around the tech, including its AI chatbot, which it has embedded in its popular apps. He, along with Huang, Musk, Li and Altman, appeared on the cover alongside Lisa Su, boss of chipmaker AMD, Anthropic chief Dario Amodei, and Google's AI lab lead Sir Demis Hassabis. \"This year, the debate about how to wield AI responsibly gave way to a sprint to deploy it as fast as possible,\" Time said as it announced its new covers. \"But the risk-averse are no longer in the driver's seat. \"Thanks to Huang, Son, Altman, and other AI titans, humanity is now flying down the highway, all gas no brakes, toward a highly automated and highly uncertain future.\" And the magazine's editor-in-chief Sam Jacobs said \"no one\" had as great an impact in 2025 than \"the individuals who imagined, designed, and built AI\". \"Humanity will determine AI's path forward, and each of us can play a role in determining AI's structure and future,\" he said. Time Forrester analyst Thomas Husson said 2025 could be seen as a \"tipping point\" for how frequently AI is now used in our day-to-day lives. \"Most consumers use it without even being aware of it,\" he told the BBC. He said AI is now being crammed into hardware, software and services - meaning it its uptake is \"much faster than during the Internet or mobile revolutions\". Some people now choose chatbots over search engines and social media to plan holidays , find Christmas gifts and discover recipes . Others, such as those worried about its energy use, training data and impact on their livelihoods, are opting-out entirely. Nik Kairinos, founder and chief executive of lab Fountech AI, said the covers were \"an honest assessment\" of the tech's influence, but he felt \"recognition should not be confused with readiness\". \"At this moment, AI can still be a saviour or scourge to humanity,\" he said. \"We are still in the early stages of building AI systems that are dependable, accountable, and aligned with human values. \"For those of us developing the technology and bringing AI tools to market, there is huge responsibility.\" Groups recognised over individuals Getty Images Steve Jobs was one of the tech founders representing the computer in 1982 This isn't the first time the Person of the Year has been a large group, with Ebola fighters being handed it in 2014 and whistleblowers in 2002. Previously, in 1982, it recognised the computer, with the magazine saying Americans had a \"giddy passion\" for the device. Time called it \"partly fad\", but said it was also \"partly a sense of how life could be made better\". The computer was represented by a number of tech entrepreneurs of the time, including Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and IBM president John Opel. Then in 2006, the Person of the Year was given to \"You\" - intended to represent the power of individuals online. Wikipedia contributors, early YouTubers and MySpace users were noted as examples of \"the many wresting power from the few and helping one another for nothing\". It continued: \"That will not only change the world, but also change the way the world changes.\"",

      "summary_tr_long": "The UK's media regulator says a porn company it fined £1m for failing to comply with the Online Safety Act has started to include more robust age checks on some of its websites. On 4 December Ofcom announced the £1m fine of AVS Group Ltd , which runs a number of pornographic websites, for not having good enough age verification methods. An Ofcom spokesperson said since the decision, AVS has implemented an \"age assurance method on certain websites\" that is \"capable of being highly effective at correctly determining whether or not a user is a child\". It added the group could still incur fines of £1,000 per day, until the body was \"satisfied\" with the changes it made across all of its platforms. Ofcom had also fined AVS an extra £50,000 for not responding to its emails since its investigation began in July. When asked if it had since heard from AVS, the regulator said it could not comment on an ongoing open investigation. After last week's £1m fine was announced, BBC News contacted a company called TubeCorporate, the adult content publishing platform behind AVS group Ltd sites, for a response, but is yet to receive one. The address which the firm uses is in the central American country Belize, and appears to be the registered address of a large number of companies - although it does not have physical offices there. The UK's Online Safety Act makes it a legal requirement for websites that host pornographic material to put in place what the regulator determines to be \"highly effective age assurance\" to prevent children from being able to easily access explicit content. Tougher age checks for porn websites were introduced in July, though some people have pointed out these could be easily avoided with a virtual private network (VPN), which reroutes internet traffic via a different country. A recent Ofcom report into the UK's media habits found VPN usage more than doubled after the start of age check requirements, rising from roughly 650,000 daily users before July and peaking at over 1.4 million in mid-August.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Shares of cloud computing giant Oracle plunged on Thursday, after weaker-than-expected revenues stoked concerns about returns from massive spending on artificial intelligence. The company's shares sank 14% after it had reported revenue of $16.1bn (£12bn) for the three months to November on Wednesday, compared with the $16.2bn projected by analysts. Revenue growth was still up 14%, with a 68% surge in sales at its AI business, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), the company said. OCI services AI developers whose demand for Oracle's AI infrastructure helped the company's shares reach new highs in recent months. But the results failed to quell fears about a potential AI bubble. In September, Oracle agreed a highly sought-after contract with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which agreed to purchase $300bn in computing power from Oracle over five years. Oracle chairman and chief technology officer Larry Ellison briefly became the world's richest man after the announcement. The firm's shares have lost 40% of their value since peaking three months ago, although they are still up by more than a third since the start of the year. In a statement issued on Wednesday, Mr Ellison struck a cautious tone. \"There are going to be a lot of changes in AI technology over the next few years and we must remain agile in response to those changes,\" he wrote. Mr Ellison also appeared to snub Nvidia, the designer of highly-sophisticated AI chips, saying Oracle would buy chips from any maker in order to serve clients. \"We will continue to buy the latest GPUs from Nvidia, but we need to be prepared and able to deploy whatever chips our customers want to buy,\" Mr Ellison declared in a policy he called \"chip neutrality\". Oracle's earnings also pulled down shares in other AI-related technology companies on Thursday. Nvidia's stock fell more than 3.5%, while shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) were nearly 4% lower. Oracle is involved in multiple AI infrastructure arrangements that have raised the prospect that major players in the sector are participating in \"circular financing\" deals whereby companies finance purchases of their own products and services. \"Oracle's earnings arrive as investors weigh whether its massive OpenAI partnership might mean overexposure with a customer currently in the spotlight over profitability concerns,\" said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne following the release of the company's quarterly report. Mr Bourne said Oracle faced mounting scrutiny over the increased debt the company has amassed to fund building data centres. Colleen McHugh, consultant to investment platform Wealthify, said the big questions being asked are whether tech stocks are overvalued and will the AI bubble burst, and given this the share price movement was not surprising. \"It's telling us that many of these tech stocks are priced for absolute perfection, and when there's a revenue miss – which was a small revenue miss to be fair by Oracle yesterday - they do get penalised,\" she told the BBC's Today programme. Others said Wall Street's negative reaction was unfounded. \"This was nothing but a great quarter for Oracle,\" said Cory Johnson, chief market strategist at Epistrophy Capital Research. \"Revenue growth of 14% is accelerating.\" Including the OpenAI deal from September, Mr Johnson noted, Oracle has signed $385bn in contracts over six months, and \"those new clients are the likes of Meta and Nvidia\". \"But AI sentiment is so bad right now, that's seen as a bad thing for Oracle,\" he added. Oracle raised a record $18bn in a massive bond sale in September, one of the largest debt issuances ever in the tech sector. \"Although Oracle's shares are buoyed by its September surge, this revenue miss will likely exacerbate concerns among already cautious investors about its OpenAI deal and its aggressive AI spending,\" Mr Bourne said. The Ellison family, supporters of US President Donald Trump, also recently purchased Paramount and have spearheaded a bid to take over another major Hollywood studio, Warner Brothers Discovery .",

      "summary_tr_long": "McDonald's Netherlands pulls AI Christmas ad after backlash Laura Cress Technology reporter McDonalds An AI-generated image from the McDonald's Netherlands advert McDonald's Netherlands has taken down a Christmas advert made with Artificial Intelligence (AI) following online backlash. The 45-second advert was produced with generative AI clips and released publicly on McDonald's Netherlands YouTube channel on 6 December. Viewers on social media denounced the use of AI in the film, with one commenter calling it \"the most god-awful ad I've seen this year\" . On 9 December McDonald's Netherlands removed the video, adding in a statement to BBC News that the moment served as \"an important learning\" as the company explored \"the effective use of AI\". The advert was created for McDonald's Netherlands by Dutch company TBWA\\Neboko and US production company The Sweetshop. Adverts which include generative AI have become a growing trend among major brands, such as Coca-Cola, particularly for the Christmas season. The McDonald's Netherlands advert depicted things that can go wrong during the Christmas break, using the slogan \"the most terrible time of the year\", and suggesting the time was better spent in the company of the fast food giant. Following its release, viewers criticised the film's uncanny-looking characters and large number of stitched together clips, calling it \"creepy\" and \"poorly edited\". As clips made using generative AI are more likely to distort the longer they run for - most clips made using the process tend to be roughly six to 10 seconds long - even a 45-second advert would likely consist of many videos edited together. The video also provoked concerns for job displacement in the industry, with one Instagram comment noting: \"No actors, no camera team..welcome to the future of filmmaking. And it sucks.\" 'Thousands of takes' Following the video being made private on the McDonald's Netherlands YouTube channel, The Sweetshop's chief executive Melanie Bridge defended the advert. As quoted in Futurism , she said the production process took \"seven weeks\" where the team \"hardly slept\" and created \"thousands of takes - then shaped them in the edit just as we would on any high-craft production\". \"It was a film.\" In a statement to BBC News, McDonald's Netherlands said the video was meant to \"reflect the stressful moments that can occur during the holidays\" but had decided to remove the advert. \"This moment serves as an important learning as we explore the effective use of AI,\" it said. Where normally a high-publicity Christmas campaign could take up to a year to pull off, companies have begun to look to firms which can produce films in a much shorter time span, using prompts from generative AI tools to create new video content. Coca-Cola seems to have been able to sway at least some of the general public with its second AI-generated Christmas ad in a row. While the use of AI to create the advert has been divisive, a report from analytics company Social Sprout found it had a 61% \"positive sentiment rating\" from commenters online. But several other businesses such as the Italian luxury fashion house Valentino have come under fire for using the technique in their campaigns, with critics calling Valentino's advert \"cheap\" and \"lazy\". BBC News has contacted The Sweetshop and TBWA\\Neboko for comment.",

He adds that one client, a hotel chain in the US, is planning to use heat from hotel servers to warm guest rooms, the hotel laundry and swimming pool. In November, a cooling system failure at a data centre in the US sent financial trading tech offline at CME Group, the world's largest exchange operator. The company has since put in place additional cooling capacity to help protect against a repeat of this incident. Currently, demand for data centres is booming, driven partly by the growth of AI technologies. But the huge amounts of energy and water that many of these facilities consume mean that they are increasingly controversial. More than 200 environmental groups in the US recently demanded a moratorium on new data centres in the country. So much so that many in the industry say traditional cooling methods – such as air cooling, where fans constantly blow air over the hottest components – is no longer sufficient for some operations. We don't have any fans whatsoever – we operate silently.\" Iceotope Iceotope says its tech can cut the cost of cooling by up to 80% Iceotope says its approach to liquid cooling, which can soothe multiple components in a data centre, not just the processing chips, may reduce cooling-related energy demands by up to 80%. The company's technology uses water to cool down the oil-based fluid that actually interacts with computer tech. But the water remains in a closed loop, so there is no need to continually draw more of it from local supplies. I ask whether the oil-based fluids in the firm's cooling system are derived from fossil fuel products and he says some of them are, though he stresses that none contain PFAS, also known as forever chemicals , which are harmful to human health. Some liquid-based data centre cooling technologies use refrigerants that do contain PFAS. Not only that, many refrigerants produce highly potent greenhouse gases, which threaten to exacerbate climate change. Two-phase cooling systems use such refrigerants says Yulin Wang, a former senior technology analyst at IDTechEx, a market research firm. The refrigerant starts out as a liquid but heat from server components causes it to evaporate into a gas and this phase change soaks up a lot of energy, meaning it is an effective way of cooling things down. In some designs, data centre tech is fully immersed in large quantities of PFAS-containing refrigerant. \"There could be some safety issues.\" In other cases, the refrigerant is piped directly to the hottest components, computer chips, only. Some companies that offer two-phase cooling are currently switching to PFAS-free refrigerants. Yulin Wang Yulin Wang warns of safety issues with some cooling chemicals Over the years, firms have experimented with wildly different approaches to cooling, in a race to find the best means of keeping data centre gadgets happy. The idea was that cold Scottish seawater would improve the efficiency of air-based cooling systems inside the device. But the company had learned much from it, says Alistair Speirs, general manager of global infrastructure in the Microsoft Azure business group. \"Without [human] operators, less things went wrong – that informed some of our operational procedures,\" he says. Initial findings showed the subsea data centre had a power usage effectiveness, or PUE, rating of 1.07 – suggesting it was far more efficient than the vast majority of land-based data centres. But in the end, Microsoft concluded that the economics of building and maintaining subsea data centres weren't very favourable. The company is still working on liquid-based cooling ideas, including microfluidics, where tiny channels of liquid flow through the many layers of a silicon chip. In July, Renkun Chen, at the University of California San Diego, and colleagues, published a paper detailing their idea for a pore-filled membrane-based cooling technology that could help to cool chips passively – without the need to actively pump fluids or blow air around. He compares it to the process by which water evaporates from a trees' leaves, inducing a pumping effect that draws more water up through the plant's trunk and along its branches to replenish the leaves. New ways of cooling down data centre tech are increasingly sought-after, says Sasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead at Hugging Face, a machine learning company. This is partly due to demand for AI – including generative AI, or large language models (LLMs), which are the systems that power chat bots. \"If you have models that are very energy-intensive, then the cooling has to be stepped up a notch,\" she says. Dr Luccioni calls for greater transparency from AI companies regarding how much energy their various products consume. For Mr Ballon, LLMs are just one form of AI – and he argues they have already \"reached their limit\" in terms of productivity.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Ben Morris Technology of Business Editor Tunnock's robot packaging A stream of hot caramel runs through the Thomas Tunnock factory just outside Glasgow. From the second floor where it is made, it runs along conveyor belts down to the first floor, bringing a a sweet, warm aroma to the building. Experienced workers have to check that it is at the right consistency, and it takes a team of 12 to spread the caramel in five layers that make up the Tunnock's wafer biscuit. \"We're making roughly 20 tonnes of caramel a day,\" says Stuart Louden, the firm's engineering and transport manager, and the fifth generation of the Tunnock family to work at the business. So basically, they walk up to the caramel and just give it a squeeze.\" Once made, a conveyor belt takes the caramel down to the floor below, where the spreading team works. \"Spreading caramel onto wafers is very, very difficult because it's so sticky,\" says Mr Louden. Stuart Louden balances tradition and efficiency at Tunnock's While this is a labour intensive part of the Tunnock's operation, most of the rest of the factory is automated. The company has always tried to use the latest technology to help keep up with the competition. \"We are a small fish in a big pond, and to try and keep up with some of these bigger companies that we are competing against, you've got to have the good machines there to get the output,\" says Mr Louden. They do have machines to spread the caramel, which work at night, but the human workforce is more flexible and takes up less space. Between them, the machines and humans turn out around seven million wafer bars and 4.5 million tea cakes a year. Raising output can be a balancing act for the firm, between maintaining their traditions and increasing output. For example, like their caramel production, Tunnock's marshmallow is made under close human supervision. Meanwhile, the wrapping of the wafer bar is folded around the product, rather than sealed at the ends. If you give people a caramel wafer, and somebody's not had one for 20 or 30, years, they go, 'I remember having one of these when I was a kid'.\" The makers of a new robot arm for the cake industry are hoping to bridge that gap between speed and tradition. Canada's Unifiller, part of Coperion a big maker of equipment for food production, spent years developing a robot arm, called HIRO. then it will go through our equipment and the the decorating tips,\" says Derek Lanoville, the research and development manager at Coperion. But making equipment for the food industry involves extra challenges - perhaps the biggest being hygiene. The bottom line is, if it's not easy to take apart, you don't clean it.\" Unifiller's robot arm comes from Swiss robotics firm Stäubli, which could supply an arm that's easy to clean. On production lines in most industries components will be the same size, often to within fractions of a millimetre. That's not the case in baking, where the cakes rolling down a line will be different - not by much - but enough,perhaps, to upset a robot. Sourdough loaves at The Bread Factory are shaped by hand For Anomarel Ogen, human hands are still essential to the baking process. Mr Ogen is head baker at The Bread Factory, which is where products for the café chain Gail's are baked. Their bakery in northwest London runs 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, supplying sourdough loaves to Gail's, as well as supermarkets, shops and restaurants. It uses around 16 tonnes of flour to produce up to 40,000 loaves a day, which sounds like a lot but, compared with the giant bakers, is still a medium-sized business. They use a range of flours that are farmed using sustainable methods that prioritise soil health. \"Look at his hands, and look how gentle he actually is with the movement, how little pressure he is actually putting in. If the recipe is tweaked, they can monitor the impact that has on the dough and change the baking process, if necessary. \"You can automate more, but you still need to put in gatekeeping right along the path, to make sure that you can safeguard the process,\" says Mr Ogen. The Bread Factory produces up to 40,000 sourdough loaves a day Introducing new tech to a production line is always a balance, says Craig Le Clair, principal analyst at the research firm Forrester, and also the author of Random Acts of Automation: How to Fight Back When Automation Threatens Your Work, Your Life, and Everything You Do. \"The key in food as well as other industries is developing a hybrid model that integrates automation without losing the \"soul\" of a handcrafted product, like a decorated cake. \"Process transformation must apply automation only to areas that benefit from consistency, speed, and volume, while keeping core value-add elements strictly human,\" he says. \"What we're focused on this year is really nailing down our scanning, vision and and safety systems so that, so that our our customers can work the way that they work, without the robot being intrusive.\" Meanwhile in Glasgow, Mr Louden has plans to upgrade his production line, but much hinges on the financial environment. \"When it comes to investing another two-and-a-half million pounds in equipment, we just need to wait, because the last couple of years just have not been the right time, and we don't want to put ourselves financially in a position that it could hurt us.\" More Technology of Business",

Those 44MW machines are actually the same ones used in a previous project, now fully operational, to the south of Aalborg in Esbjerg.",
      "summary_tr_long": "Meet the biggest heat pumps in the world Chris Baraniuk Technology Reporter MVV Energie MVV Energie is building the world's most powerful heat pump systems The pipe that will supply the heat pump, drawing water from the River Rhine in Germany, is so big that you could walk through it, fully upright, I'm told. \"We plan to take 10,000 litres per second,\" says Felix Hack, project manager at MVV Environment, an energy company, as he describes the 2m diameter pipes that will suck up river water in Mannheim, and then return it once heat from the water has been harvested. In October, parent firm MVV Energie announced its plan to build what could be the most powerful heat pump modules ever. Two units, each with a capacity of 82.5 megawatts. That's enough to supply around 40,000 homes, in total, via a district heating system. MVV Energie aims to build the system on the site of a coal power plant that is converting to cleaner technologies. The scale of the heat pumps was determined partly by limits on the size of machinery that could be transported through the streets of Mannheim, or potentially via barges along the Rhine. \"It might come via the river.\" One person well aware of the project is Alexandre de Rougemont, at Everllence (formerly MAN Energy Solutions), another German company that also makes extremely large heat pumps. This same process occurs in heat pumps designed to supply single homes, it just happens on a much larger scale in giant heat pumps that serve entire city districts. \"There was a lot of pressure on us to change the heat generation to new sources, especially renewable sources,\" explains Mr Hack as he discusses the decommissioning of coal-fired units at the Mannheim plant. The site is right by the Rhine, already has a hefty electricity grid connection, and is plugged in to the district heating network, so it makes sense to install the heat pumps here, he says. He notes that the technology is possible partly thanks to the availability of very large compressors in the oil and gas industry – where they are used to compress fossil fuels for storage or transportation, for example. MVV Energie The new heat pump at Mannheim will transfer heat from the Rhine Work on the Mannheim project is due to start next year. The heat pumps – with a combined capacity of 162MW – are set to become fully operational in the winter of 2028-29. Mr Hack adds that a multi-step filter system will prevent the heat pumps sucking up fish from the river, and that modelling suggests the system will affect the average temperature of the river by less than 0.1C. The Mannheim heat pump setup will cost €200m ($235m; £176m). Mr de Rougemont at Everllence says that, at his company, heat-pump equipment costs roughly €500,000 per megawatt of installed capacity – this does not include the additional cost of buildings, associated infrastructure and so on. Everllence Everllence has plans for heat pumps even bigger than this one in Esberg Everllence is currently working on a project in Aalborg, Denmark that will be even more powerful than the system in Mannheim, with a total capacity of 176MW. It will use smaller modules, however – four 44MW units – and is due to become operational in 2027, when it will supply nearly one third of all heating demand in the town. Those 44MW machines are actually the same ones used in a previous project, now fully operational, to the south of Aalborg in Esbjerg. There, they don't run at maximum capacity but rather supply 35MW each. Large hot water storage tanks, each able to hold 200,000 cubic metres of liquid, will give the system added flexibility, adds Mr de Rougemont: \"When the electricity price is high, you stop your heat pump and only provide heat from the storage.\" Veronika Wilk at the Austrian Institute of Technology says, \"Heat pumps and district heating systems are a great fit.\" Such systems can harvest heat from bodies of water or even wastewater from sewage treatment plants. Getty Images Helsinki is overhauling its district heating system All the systems mentioned so far harvest energy from water sources but, less commonly, very large heat pumps can use the air as a heat source, too. \"We calculated that we would need to build a tunnel more than 20km long to the ocean, to get enough water [with a] temperature high enough.\" Helsinki is in the process of radically overhauling its district heating system. The city has added heat pumps, biomass burners and electric boilers to a 1,400km network that links up nearly 90% of buildings in the Finnish capital, adds Mr Aaltonen. Heat pumps convert single kilowatt hours of electricity into multiple kilowatt hours of heat but electric boilers can't do this and are therefore considered less efficient. I ask why Helen Oy decided to install hundreds of megawatts of these boilers and Mr Aaltonen says that they are cheaper to install than heat pumps and having them also means he and colleagues don't have to rely entirely on the air, which is limited in terms of how much heat it can provide at scale. There are no heat pumps in the UK that rival the systems under development in Denmark, Germany and Finland. The minimum planned capacity of the network is 12MW. It will feature three 4MW air-to-water heat pumps, with the first unit due to become operational in 2028. Keith Baker at Glasgow Caledonian University, who researches district heating systems, says the UK has opportunities to make more of this technology.",

It is partly thanks to image processing technology in the scanner but also a special material called cadmium zinc telluride (CZT), which allows the machine to produce highly detailed, 3D images of patients' lungs. \"You get beautiful pictures from this scanner,\" says Dr Kshama Wechalekar, head of nuclear medicine and PET. \"It's an amazing feat of engineering and physics.\" The CZT in the machine, which was installed at the hospital last August, was made by Kromek – a British company. Kromek is one of just a few firms in the world that can make CZT. You may never have heard of the stuff but, in Dr Wechalekar's words, it is enabling a \"revolution\" in medical imaging. This wonder material has many other uses, such as in X-ray telescopes, radiation detectors and airport security scanners. Investigations of patients' lungs performed by Dr Wechalekar and her colleagues involve looking for the presence of many tiny blood clots in people with long Covid, or a larger clot known as a pulmonary embolism, for example. The £1m scanner works by detecting gamma rays emitted by a radioactive substance that is injected into patients' bodies. But the scanner's sensitivity means less of this substance is needed than before: \"We can reduce doses about 30%,\" says Dr Wechalekar. While CZT-based scanners are not new in general, large, whole-body scanners such as this one are a relatively recent innovation. Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust Dr Kshama Wechalekar with the latest scanner at London's Royal Brompton Hospital CZT itself has been around for decades but it is notoriously difficult to manufacture. \"It has taken a long time for it to develop into an industrial-scale production process,\" says Arnab Basu, founding chief executive of Kromek. In the company's facility at Sedgefield, there are 170 small furnaces in a room that Dr Basu describes as looking \"like a server farm\". \"Atom by atom, the crystals are rearranged […] so they become all aligned,\" says Dr Basu. The newly formed CZT, a semiconductor, can detect tiny photon particles in X-rays and gamma rays with incredible precision – like a highly specialised version of the light-sensing, silicon-based image sensor in your smartphone camera. Whenever a high energy photon strikes the CZT, it mobilises an electron and this electrical signal can be used to make an image. It retains all the important information such as timing, the energy of the X-ray that is hitting the CZT detector – you can create colour, or spectroscopic images.\" He adds that CZT-based scanners are currently in use for explosives detection at UK airports, and for scanning checked baggage in some US airports. \"We expect CZT to come into the hand luggage segment over the next [few] years.\" Kromek Special furnaces are needed to make CZT But it's not always easy to get your hands on CZT. Henric Krawczynski at Washington University in St Louis in the US has used the material before on space telescopes attached to high altitude balloons. These detectors can pick up X-rays emitted by both neutron stars and plasma around black holes. Prof Krawczynski wants very thin, 0.8mm pieces of CZT for his telescopes because this helps to reduce the amount of background radiation they pick up, allowing for a clearer signal. \"We'd like to buy 17 new detectors,\" he says. \"It's really difficult to get these thin ones.\" He was unable to source the CZT from Kromek. \"We support many, many research organisations,\" he adds, \"It's very difficult for us to do a hundred different things. Each research [project] needs a very particular type of detector structure.\" For Prof Krawczynski, it's not a crisis – he says he might use either CZT that he has from previous research, or cadmium telluride, an alternative, for his next mission. That upcoming mission was due to fly from Antarctica in December but \"all the dates are in flux\", says Prof Krawczynski, because of the US government shutdown . Diamond Light Source CZT will be used in an upgrade of Diamond Light Source Many other scientists use CZT. In the UK, a major upgrade of the Diamond Light Source research facility in Oxfordshire – costing half a billion pounds – will improve its capabilities thanks to the installation of CZT-based detectors. Diamond Light Source is a synchrotron, which fires electrons around a giant ring at nearly the speed of light. Magnets cause these whizzing electrons to lose some energy in the form of X-rays, and these are directed off from the ring in beamlines so that they may be used to analyse materials, for example. With Diamond Light Source's upgrade, due to complete in 2030, the X-rays produced will be significantly brighter, meaning that existing sensors would not be able to detect them properly. \"There's no point in spending all this money in upgrading these facilities if you can't detect the light they produce,\" says Matt Veale, group leader for detector development at the Science and Technology Facilities Council, a stakeholder in the Diamond Light Source. That's why, here too, CZT is the material of choice.",

      "summary_tr": "Mr Logtenberg is the co-founder of CEAD, a company that designs and builds large-format 3D printers at its base in the Dutch town of Delft. And in the 12 months since they have been operating the Marine Application Centre in Delft, they have already built a prototype 12m fast boat, similar to a RIB, for the Dutch Navy. How far could 3D printing go in the maritime world?",
      "summary_tr_long": "Will boats be a breakthrough for 3D printing tech? After two years of experimentation, the material was finally right: a particular mix of thermoplastics and fibreglass that is strong, has no need of extra coating to protect it from sunlight, and is resistant to fouling and marine growth. The perfect base, says Mr Logtenberg, from which to 3D print a boat. But after months of tweaking the chemistry, it took just four days for the first hull to roll off the printer at the new factory that Mr Logtenberg and his colleagues run. \"We're automating almost 90% of the boat-building process, and in superfast time,\" he says. We print one now every week.\" It's the kind of story that 3D printing has long promised. Those promises haven't always been fulfilled – but Mr Logtenberg is convinced that the maritime sector is one where 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, can play a transformational role. Mr Logtenberg is the co-founder of CEAD, a company that designs and builds large-format 3D printers at its base in the Dutch town of Delft. Until now, its business has been to provide the printers for others to use, but with boatbuilding CEAD decided to get involved in production as well. \"3D printed boats still need to be accepted by the market,\" says Mr Logtenberg. [So] instead of just building machines, we're going to do it ourselves.\" CEAD The printer builds the boat one layer at a time Traditional fibreglass boat building requires a mould and considerable manual work to make sure the vessel is of the required strength. In additive manufacturing, the work has already been done at the design stage, in creating the software and the printer itself (which is labour intensive). 3D printers work by building up tiny layers of the basic material, to a predetermined digital design. In the production phase, as long as there is a supply of the base material, there is little or no need for human intervention. Much 3D printing operates on a relatively small scale – dentistry is one area where it has made a major impact. CEAD's largest 3D printer is nearly 40m (131ft) long, and has been used by a customer in Abu Dhabi to print an electric ferry. And in the 12 months since they have been operating the Marine Application Centre in Delft, they have already built a prototype 12m fast boat, similar to a RIB, for the Dutch Navy. \"Normally when the Navy buys a boat, it takes them years before they receive it and they pay quite some money,\" says Mr Logtenberg. And we can learn from it and build another one in six weeks and even recycle the first one.\" Another fast growth area is the use of unmanned vessels – nautical drones. CEAD recently took part in a test with Nato Special Forces in which drones were built on site in a matter of hours, with designs changing according to operational requirements. The ability to relocate production makes 3D printing incredibly flexible, according to Mr Logtenberg. \"It doesn't matter whether it's a 6m small work boat or a 12m military boat. \"The only transport we need to do is the base material, which comes in big bags and it's very transport efficient, compared to a boat.\" Matthew Kenyon Maarten Logtenberg stands with an 8m-long printed hull Raw Idea Raw Idea uses recycled plastic in the hulls of its boats Not far from CEAD, in the port city of Rotterdam, a company called Raw Idea and their 'Tanaruz' brand are looking at making a similar impact in the leisure market, especially rentals. \"Consumers are hesitant [because of the novelty], but the rental market is really keen,\" says Joyce Pont, Raw Idea's managing director. \"It's marketing, you can go to the socials and say, 'we've got a 3D printed boat', and everybody wants to look at and touch that boat.\" Another selling point is that Raw Idea uses a mix of glass fibre and recycled consumer plastics (fizzy drinks bottles and so on). That's one reason why the price is currently comparable to a traditionally-built boat, because recycled material costs more to buy. \"I'm convinced that in five years from now, 3D printed boats will take over the market for the fast-driving boat, like work boats, like speed boats,\" she tells me. Both RAW Idea and CEAD are engaging with European regulators almost in real time, as they use new materials and new ideas to produce vessels that cannot be compared to what has come before. 3D printing has often been hailed as a revolutionary technology but hasn't always delivered on those hopes. \"It's all being seen as one thing, but you have metal printing, you have polymer or large-scale printing, all these different applications. \"There are many applications that didn't succeed because it was not competitive enough, but there are a few where it actually happened and is being used.\" Additive manufacturing is being used more frequently in the shipping industry, but in technical niches, rather than entire hulls. How far could 3D printing go in the maritime world? Joyce Pont is sceptical whether that moment will arrive in the foreseeable future – she sees the building of superyachts and other such vessels as a 'craft' which will resist automation. \"Building a 12-meter boat, I never expected that a year ago,\" he says. It's going to take maybe a decade or two before we are going to completely print [a ship's hull], because there will be more need of material research.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Scammers hacked her phone and stole thousands - so how did they get her details? Joe Tidy Cyber correspondent, BBC World Service Getty Images Data breaches are getting so common that it can be hard to know how to react when it happens to you. Being a victim of a data breach increases your chances of being targeted by criminals and scammers. Sue told the BBC how scammers went after her. Sue had her digital life hijacked by scammers She was a victim of what's known as a Sim swap attack - where scammers trick a network operator into thinking they're the account holder to get a new Sim card for a mobile device. \"The scammers took over my Gmail account and then locked me out of my bank accounts because they failed security checks,\" she said. Sue also had a credit card opened in her name and the criminals purchased more than £3,000 in vouchers. It took several trips to the branches of her bank and mobile phone provider to get her accounts back. \"The criminals also did a sinister thing after breaking into my WhatsApp,\" she said. \"They sent messages to horse riding groups I am in warning there were people on their way to stab the horses.\" We searched hacker databases using online tools like haveibeenpwned.com and Constella Intelligence to see if Sue's details were previously compromised. Her phone number, email address, date of birth and physical address were all exposed in data breaches at gambling platform PaddyPower in 2010 and email validation tool Verifications.io in 2019. Hannah Baumgaertner, from cyber firm Silobreaker, said attackers likely used the personal data leaked in previous breaches to conduct the Sim swap attack. \"Once they had access to Sue's phone number they were were able to intercept any security codes sent to verify her identity for her Gmail account,\" she said. Fran from Brazil told the BBC she found a user had registered to her Netflix account - and increased her monthly subscription. \"I was charged $9.90 (£7.50) on my payment card, even though I hadn't made this purchase,\" she said. \"I immediately contacted my family to find out if anyone had added another profile to the account we share, but they all said no.\" Fran was a victim of a common scam where her Netflix account was hijacked by a freeloader. It's not known exactly how they got into her account and the murky world of cybercrime means it is difficult to pinpoint if a single data breach led to someone being scammed. But we found Fran's email address had been exposed in at least four data breaches including hacks of Internet Archive (2024), Trellov (2024), Descomplica (2021) and Wattpad (2020) according to the website haveibeenpwned.com. The password she used for her Netflix account is not in publicly known databases but might be in others. \"There is a huge market for cracked Netflix, Disney and Spotify accounts\", said Alon Gal, co founder of cyber security company Hudson Rock. \"It's a low-barrier entry point for cybercrime, turning one company's data leak into widespread, ongoing abuse.\" Scammers often combine stolen private information with public information. Leah, who didn't want to give her real name, runs a small business using Facebook adverts and was recently targeted in a long running scam apparently originating from Vietnam. I clicked on the link and entered my details on the fake Meta page and the scammers were able to take over my business account even though I had 2 factor authentication. \"They then posted child sexual abuse videos under my name which got me blocked. I was even barred from using Messenger to complain to Meta.\" In the three days it took Leah to get back her business account back the scammers had run hundreds of pounds of adverts paid for by her. Alberto Casares from Constella Intelligence searched hacker databases and found Leah's email address and other details were taken in data breaches at Gravatar (2020) and this year's Qantas (third-party breach). \"It looks like the attackers used a common technique of linking up Leah's private stolen email address with her publicly listed business number to launch a targeted phishing attack against the email account.\" They could have done this themselves or used a data broker to pay for a number of potential targets he said. Mass data breaches Mass data breaches are fuelling scams and secondary hacks around the world, with several high profile attacks coming in 2025 alone. According to Proton Mail's Data Breach Observatory, there have been 794 verified breaches from identifiable sources discovered so far in 2025 with more than 300 million individual records exposed. \"Criminals pay premium prices for stolen data because it consistently generates profit through fraud, extortion, and cyberattacks,\" said Eamonn Maguire from the firm. Aside from notifying customers and regulators about breaches, there are no hard and fast rules on what companies should do for victims. Last year, Ticketmaster (which saw 500m people affected by a breach) offered this to some people. Marks and Spencer and Qantas, for example, have not offered these services to customers. Co-op chose to give victims a £10 voucher - if they spent £40 in its shops. Some are trying to seek compensation in the courts, with a growing trend of class action lawsuits - though these are notoriously hard to win because it is difficult to prove how individuals have been impacted. T-Mobile has begun paying customers affected by a major data breach in 2021 which affected 76m customers. The firm agreed to pay $350m - with payments reportedly ranging from $50 to $300.",

      "summary_tr_long": "\"It has potential for extraordinary benefits - we will have to work through societal disruptions.\" But the confusing question lingering over the AI hype is whether it is a bubble at risk of bursting - as, if so, it may well be a spectacular burst akin to the dotcom crash at the start of the century, with consequences for us all. Bloomberg via Getty Images A walkway runs along the length of Googleplex, passing by a giant dinosaur skeleton, a beach volleyball pitch and staff lunching in the winter sun The Bank of England has already warned of a \"sudden correction\" in global financial markets, saying \"market valuations appear stretched\" for tech AI firms. Asked whether Google would be immune from a potential bubble burst, Mr Pichai said it could weather that potential storm - but for all his starry-eyed excitement around the possibilities of AI, he also issued a warning: \"I think no company is going to be immune, including us.\" So why, then, is Google investing more than $90bn a year in the AI build-out, a three-fold increase in just four years, at the very moment these suggestions are being discussed? Chipmaker turned AI systems pioneer Nvidia in Santa Clara is now worth more than $5 trillion. A 10-minute drive south, in Cupertino, is Apple HQ, hovering around $4 trillion; while 15 minutes west is $1.9 trillion Meta (previously Facebook). Google's parent firm Alphabet, headquartered in Mountain View, is worth about $3.3 trillion, and has almost doubled in value since April, (which every Googler on campus will no doubt be feeling through the value of their stock options) The purely financial consequences of this trend are significant enough. And that market value is now more highly concentrated in a few firms than it was during the dotcom bubble in 1999, according to the IMF. But he concedes: \"It's also true when we go through these investment cycles, there are moments we overshoot collectively as an industry… \"So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.\" Sundar Pichai: \"We have this phrase at Google, which is 'uncomfortably exciting'.\" Now, a distinction is emerging in the markets between those businesses that rely on often borrowed money and complicated deals to access the chips that power their AI, and the biggest tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which can fund investment in chips and data from their own pockets. The CPU (central processing unit) is the primary component of a computer - essentially its brain - that performs most of the processing and control functions, while GPUs (graphics processing units) perform more specialised processing, executing many parallel tasks at once - this can include AI. The TPUs are part of Sundar Pichai's overall strategy of owning the entire scientific supply chain - from the silicon to the data, plus the AI models and everything in between A core aspect of the AI boom has been the mad dash to amass lots of top-performing chips and put them into data centres (or the physical facilities that store, process and run large amounts of data and software). The chips race - and the OpenAI storm The terrace of the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel, a sprawling 16-acre estate near the Santa Cruz mountains that serves crab rolls and $35 signature vodka martinis, is where the big Silicon Valley deal-making gets done. Getty Images Sam Altman: 'What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure' In a podcast episode that aired last month, an OpenAI investor questioned how the company's spending commitments tallied with its revenues, to which co-founder Sam Altman shot back, challenging the revenue figures quoted, and adding: \"If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough.\" He has since shared a lengthy post on X, explaining, among other things, that OpenAI is looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next eight years and why he believes now is the time to invest in scaling up their technology. But he also said: \"What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure.\" Getty Images Elon Musk and Larry Ellison are said to have begged Nvidia's Jensen Huang to sell them more top-performing chips during a dinner in Nobu Elsewhere, there have been notable very recent falls in share prices of AI infrastructure companies - Coreweave, a start-up that supplies OpenAI, saw its shares lose 26% of their value earlier this month. ChatGPT versus Gemini 3.0 None of this has dampened the excitement over AI's potential within the industry. Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, launched to great fanfare earlier this week — this will pitch Google in a direct battle with OpenAI and its still-dominant ChatGPT for the market share. By 2030, data centres around the world will use about as much electricity as India did in 2023, according to the IMF. I put this to Google's Mr Pichai, asking if it is coherent to have ambitions to generate 95% of electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030 - as the UK government does - and also be an AI superpower? Take Amazon - its share price slumped to $6 and its market capitalisation fell to $4bn during that crash, yet some 25 years on Jeff Bezos and his company are very much going strong. The physical footprint left behind, however, containing sheer computing firepower for the deployment of mass AI technologies, will inevitably shape our economy and could well also shape how we work and learn - and who dominates the world for the rest of the 21st Century.",

      "summary_tr_long": "On the front line of Europe's standoff with Russia's sanction-busting shadow fleet Jessica Parker, Berlin correspondent, Baltic Sea and Ned Davies, BBC Verify Getty Images The BBC joined coastguards on the front line of Europe's uneasy standoff with Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\" Out on the western Baltic, a coastguard officer radios a nearby, sanctioned oil tanker. After the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy, which Moscow is accused of dodging by shipping oil on aged tankers often with obscure ownership or insurance. European coastguards and navies are regularly coming in contact with vessels in Russia's shadow fleet which they suspect are transporting oil Some \"shadow\" ships are even suspected of undersea sabotage, illicit drone launches or \"spoofing\" their location data. As the BBC has learned, a growing network of \"shadow\" ships are sailing without a valid national flag, which can render vessels stateless and without proper insurance. That is a troubling trend, given many are practically \"floating rust buckets\", says senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI, Michelle Wiese Bockmann. Driven by record sanctions and tighter enforcement, the number of falsely flagged ships globally has more than doubled this year to over 450, most of them tankers, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) database. The BBC has been tracking one ship that appears to have sailed without a valid flag. The head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says that vessels travel back and forth, past Estonia, to major Russian oil terminals The head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says they have seen dozens of such passing vessels this year whereas they used to see just one or two. What's more, he suggests, it's brazen: \"There's no secret made about it.\" We spot the tanker Unity on the MarineTraffic app, the day we board an Estonian (British-built) Minehunter that is also used in Nato's Baltic Sentry patrols to protect critical infrastructure. Journeying east, Unity is over 100 miles away but sailing in our direction. The BBC has investigated its history and it offers an illuminating insight into the enigmatic life of a shadow ship. Tracking data shows that Unity has passed through the English Channel four times in the last twelve months, including journeys between Russian ports and India; a key oil customer that has not signed up to the price cap. Originally known as Ocean Explorer, the tanker was built in 2009 and flew the flag of Singapore for more than a decade. Back in 2019, it was named in a UN report for alleged involvement in a ship-to-ship transfer with a vessel that had been sanctioned for its role in transporting fuel to North Korea - which is among other countries also charged with utilising elusive shadow ships. By late 2021, the vessel – which that year operated under the name Ocean Vela – took the flag of the Marshall Islands but was struck from that list in 2024, a registry spokesperson told us, because the ship's then-operator and beneficial owning company had been sanctioned by the UK. The tanker appears to have had three further names since 2021 (Beks Swan, March and Unity) and three further flags (Panama, Russia and Gambia) but always retains a unique IMO number. Lesotho is a small, landlocked African enclave kingdom that, according to the IMO, does not have an official registry. Over the past year, Unity has made several voyages to and from Russian oil ports The BBC has tried to contact Unity's listed owner, a Dubai-registered company called FMTC Ship Charter LLC , but our emails and our calls went unanswered. The beneficial owners of 60% of shadow fleet vessels remain essentially unknown, according to maritime intelligence company Windward AI. By 6 November, it was anchored outside the Russian port of Ust-Luga where it remains at the time of publication. The tanker was added to the UK and EU's ever-growing list of sanctioned vessels earlier this year but, like so many others, continues to do business despite other difficulties. Planet Labs At the time of publication the vessel was anchored just outside the major Russian oil port, Ust-Luga Unity is just one of hundreds of vessels subject to UK and EU service and port bans as both London and Brussels try to increase pressure on the Kremlin. Nevertheless, Russian revenues from crude and oil product sales were $13.1bn (£9.95bn) in October alone, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) - although this was down by $2.3bn when compared with the same month a year ago. Analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air finds that \"shadow\" tankers, either sanctioned or suspected, account for 62% of shipped Russian crude oil exports, while China and India are by far the biggest customers for crude, followed by Turkey and the European Union itself. \"Every day in the Baltic, there's suspicious activity,\" a Nato official told the BBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \"You need to see it in a larger perspective,\" says investigator Jonatan Tholin when I suggest these measures appear less than muscular: \"This information can be used in our maritime surveillance.\" But as Europe steps up checks and watches the waves, Windward's Michelle Wiese Bockmann spies something else: \"You can literally see the international rules-based order crumbling through the sanctions-circumventing tactics of these vessels.\" There is a lot at stake for the environment and on security, she says, and meanwhile \"the dark fleet is getting darker\". The BBC approached Russia's embassy in London for comment. \"Labelling ships used to export Russian oil as 'shadow fleet' is discriminatory and misleading,\" the embassy said, and instances of invalid flags were typically down to \"easily resolved\" issues such as administrative delays.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Can technology fix fashion's sizing crisis? Shiona McCallum Senior technology reporter BBC Most women will relate to the misery of inconsistent sizing in high-street shops. A pair of jeans could easily be a size 10 by one brand and a size 14 in another, leaving customers confused and disheartened. It has led to a global deluge of returns, costing fashion retailers an estimated £190bn a year as would-be shoppers wonder what size they're meant to buy from which store. I didn't have to look far to find people experiencing the problem. \"I don't trust high-street sizing,\" one person tells me, as she browses one of London's popular shopping streets. \"To be honest, I buy by how it looks rather than the actual size.\" She's one of many women who often orders multiple versions of the same item to find one that fits, before sending the rest back, fuelling a culture of mass returns. A new generation of sizing tech A growing cluster of tech companies are now attempting to fix the problem. Tools such as 3DLook, True Fit and EasySize focus on helping customers choose the right size at checkout, using body scans via smartphone photos to suggest the most accurate fit. Meanwhile, virtual fitting-room platforms including Google's virtual try-on, Doji, Alta, Novus, DRESSX Agent and WEARFITS allow shoppers to create digital avatars and preview how items might look. These systems aim to increase confidence when buying online. More recently, AI-powered shopping agents have begun entering the market too. Daydream, allows users to describe what they are looking for and then recommends options. OneOff pulls together looks from celebrities to find similar items, while Phia scans tens of thousands of websites to compare prices and surface early \"size insights.\" While these tools work at the e-commerce stage, a new UK start-up, Fit Collective, is taking a different approach: trying to prevent the problem earlier in the production process. Founder Phoebe Gormley argues AI can potentially fix the sizing before clothes reach the stores. The 31-year-old - who is no data scientist, rather a tailor - previously launched Savile Row's first female tailors, making made-to-measure garments for a range of women. \"They would all come in and say, 'high-street sizing is so bad',\" she tells me. She says fashion's current model is a \"downward spiral\" where brands make cheaper garments to offset huge return rates, which leads to unhappy customers and more waste. Since launching last year, Fit Collective has raised £3 million in pre-seed funding, reportedly the largest amount ever secured by a solo female founder in the UK. \"As far as we know, we are the first solution comparing all the manufacturing data and the commercial data,\" she says. Phoebe's new venture uses machine learning to analyse a range of data - including returns, sales figures and customer emails - to really understand why something didn't fit. It then turns this into clear advice for design and production teams, who can adjust patterns, sizing and materials before manufacturing begins. Her system may tell a firm, for example, to take a few centimetres off the length of an item of clothing to reduce the number of returns overall. This saves money for the company and time for the consumer. Despite what the labels may say, it's clear these jeans aren't all the same size While many in the industry welcome such tools, some warn technology alone won't fix fashion's sizing problem. \"People aren't mannequins, they're unique, and so are their fit preferences,\" says Paul Alger, Director of International Business at the UK Fashion and Textile Association. He warns sizing can be nuanced, with body measurements rarely aligning with a number on a label. \"It's very difficult, it's very subjective,\" he says. \"Most of us are a different shape and size - around the world people have different body shapes.\" And then there's the issue of vanity sizing - or \"emotional sizing\" according to Mr Alger - where a brand will deliberately choose to create a more generous fit in the knowledge that a consumer, especially in women's wear, will prefer to shop there. \"Once these sizing norms are established in a collection, brands will usually refer back to them each season so they are effectively creating their own brand sizing,\" he says. Sophie De Salis, sustainability policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium, says retailers are increasingly aware of the issue, from a cost-saving and sustainability perspective. \"Smarter sizing tech and AI-driven solutions are key to reducing returns and supporting the industry's sustainability goals. BRC members are working with innovative tech providers to help their customers buy the most suitable size and reduce returns,\" she says. With returns now a board room issue and sustainability pressures mounting, more fashion houses may well consider data-driven design. While no single solution is likely to solve inconsistent sizing completely, the emergence of tools like Fit Collective, alongside a growing ecosystem of virtual try-ons and size-prediction platforms, suggests the industry is beginning to shift.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Call of Duty is back, and it's got a battle on its hands Tom Richardson, BBC Newsbeat and Mel Ramsay, BBC News Activision Actress Kiernan Shipka takes a central role in Black Ops 7's campaign There are some things you can always rely on, and a new Call of Duty game coming out each year is one of them. As one of the best-known names in video games, it's a series that needs little introduction. According to publisher Activision, it's sold an estimated 500 million copies, a movie adaptation is on the way, and despite having launched in 2003 it still reliably appears at - or near - the top of the annual bestseller charts. But this year the world's top military shooter might have a fight on its hands. Battlefield 6, which has been a huge hit for rival gaming giant Electronic Arts, has been drawing attention away from its veteran competitor. And long-time Call of Duty fans have been increasingly vocal over worries about the series losing touch with its roots. The clash of the multiplayer titans comes at an interesting time for the makers of Call of Duty, who've had to issue responses to fan concerns about the series losing its way . It has long offered players the chance to purchase \"operator skins\" that change their character's appearance. They're a frequent source of brand crossovers, and previous designs have been based on stars including footballer Neymar Jr, streamer NickMercs and rapper Nicki Minaj. But when Activision revealed skins based on 90s cartoon characters Beavis and Butthead earlier this year, there was a backlash. Fans accused the company of trying to mimic Fortnite, the ever-popular multiplayer game famous for its sometimes unlikely crossovers, which have included pop star Sabrina Carpenter and an AI-voiced Darth Vader in 2025 . Activision said the feedback from fans \"hit home\" and that it took the complaints about the series losing its identity seriously. It's also being released after parent company Microsoft increased prices of its Game Pass subscription service by 20% , angering many players. Activision Black Ops games thrust players into a world of espionage and conspiracy When BBC News sits down with lead producer Natalie Pohorski and senior comms director Stephanie Snowdon, they're keen to talk up Black Ops 7's single-player story campaign. The equivalent mode in Battlefield 6 was considered underwhelming by reviewers, and Call of Duty teams are renowned for their skill in crafting explosive set pieces in their narrative modes. Black Ops-themed installments of the series usually tell Hollywood blockbuster-style stories of secret agents uncovering vast conspiracies. Black Ops 7 is a direct sequel to 2012's Black Ops 2, set in 2035 and tells a story involving a global terrorist threat and a murky big tech company. Natalie says that the \"Black Ops identity\" allows the developers to explore themes that others can't. \"There's a lot of really interesting and timeless ideas... there's endless ways to explore them,\" she says. \"And then we ask a lot of questions that could apply to any era - questions of trust, can you believe what you're seeing?\" Activision Milo Ventimiglia takes over the role of hero David Mason Being one of the biggest names in gaming also allows Activision to attract some big-name talent to Call of Duty projects. For Black Ops 7, that includes Kiernan Shipka, best known for her role in Netflix's Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, and This Is Us star Milo Ventimiglia. Kiernan tells BBC News she's aware of Call of Duty's huge profile, and the expectations of its fans. She says being involved was \"honestly more exciting than anything.\" \"I love a fandom,\" she says. \"And I think that when something over time garners such passion from fans, that means you're stepping into something really cool. \"The reaction is going to be what the reaction is going to be. \"If I let that stuff in, that's not a good thing.\" As someone who played Call of Duty when he was younger, Milo says he's also aware of the standards fans have. \"I mean, I hope I don't muck it up for anybody,\" he says. Asked whether he thinks players are getting \"fatigued\" with the annual series, he says Black Ops 7 won't disappoint. \"I think this one just blows the others out of the water completely in the storytelling and where we go,\" he says. But Call of Duty's campaigns, no matter how well-crafted or explosive they are, aren't the main reason players turn up for the series each year. The game owes its long-running success to the popularity of its multiplayer modes, and the performance of Black Ops 7 will be judged on whether they succeed. When they're asked if Battlefield's impressive player numbers affect their approach to development, Natalie and Stephanie insist they're only focused on making Black Ops 7 \"the best game it can be\". As for what it offers that Battlefield can't, Stephanie says, without directly comparing the two, that Call of Duty has \"variety and volume\" of experiences to offer. \"But more broadly, she says, \"I see games as a way for people to connect, to have fun. \"They are certainly responsible for some awesome relationships in my life. \"I hope that people continue to forge those connections and bonds and relationships and there's just more of us playing games together in however many years from now.\" Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here .",

      "summary_tr_long": "Fire-blocking chemicals promise safer buildings Chris Baraniuk Technology Reporter Getty Images Fire resistant materials can buy time for fire fighters I'm peering into a large vat containing a perfectly clear liquid – a special kind of flame retardant for wood products. I have,\" says Stephen McCann, general & technical manager at Halt, a wood treatment company in Belfast. But this liquid, containing a substance called Burnblock, has been shown to prevent fire taking hold of wood in tests. In a video the firm has shared online , two small model houses are blasted with a blow torch. One, treated with a different product, is engulfed in flames to such an extent that it collapses. The Burnblock-treated model gets heavily charred in one corner but remains otherwise unharmed. Neither Mr McCann nor Hroar Bay-Smidt, chief executive of Burnblock itself, a Danish firm, will confirm the ingredients. However, documentation on Burnblock's website from the Danish Technological Institute states the flame retardant ingredient is \"a natural component in the body\" and that the mixture also contains citric acid and \"a natural component in some berries\". Flame retardants, chemicals added to products to try and slow down how they burn, have been around in various forms for centuries. But many of the flame retardants developed in the 20th Century are highly toxic . \"There hasn't been a lot of investment in replacements so now all of a sudden people are scrambling to find them,\" says Alex Morgan, a chemist and flame retardant expert at the University of Dayton Research Institute in the US. When you try to set fire to wood treated with Burnblock, the material forms a protective layer of char, explains Mr Bay-Smidt. \"That helps absorb the heat and slows the fire's spread.\" And, it prevents oxygen feeding the flames. Halt, which has been operating in Belfast for nearly four years, has supplied Burnblock-treated wood products to hundreds of locations around the UK and Ireland. From restaurants to hotels and even HS2. For the latter, Halt provided treated hoardings used to fence off construction areas in tunnels. \"It could be quite difficult to get out of the tunnel so they need as much time as possible to evacuate [in the event of a fire],\" says Mr McCann. I ask whether any of the buildings or facilities constructed with wood treated by Halt have ever been affected by a fire to date – \"No\" is the answer. Halt exposes wood to a vacuum, pressure and a flame retardant fluid In one of Halt's buildings they have a huge machine called an autoclave, consisting mainly of two large horizontal tubes. When the tube below it is loaded with pieces of wood, it first exposes them to a vacuum, to open up the wood's pores, says Mr McCann. Then, pressure appropriate to the species of wood in question is applied, along with the treatment fluid. \"What that pressure is doing is, it's forcing the fire retardant into the very core of the timber,\" says Mr McCann. After this, the wood goes into a large kiln where it is dried in a process that can last anywhere from 10 days to six weeks. It's carefully managed – drying that happens too quickly or too slowly can warp the wood. \"Timber is an amazing material,\" says Richard Hull, professor emeritus and fire retardants expert at the University of Lancashire. \"There was a lot of work done on clay nanocomposites in the early 2000s,\" he says. \"Now, 20-25 years later, essentially 99% of that has fizzled out.\" University of Dayton Research Institute There's a scramble to find new flame retardant chemicals says Alex Morgan While timber tends to burn at a fixed rate, making plastic flame resistant is another story because plastics tend to burn at an accelerating rate, he explains. Dr Morgan adds that he calls polyethylene, a type of plastic commonly used in construction, \"solid gasoline\" because of its similar chemical structure and capacity to burn rapidly. In Australia, First Graphene says it has found a way to slow the spread of fire in plastics by adding graphene – tiny flakes of carbon atoms arranged in honeycomb lattices. Michael Bell, managing director and chief executive, says the firm's solution, PureGRAPH, has already been added to products including protective footwear and conveyor belts used in the mining industry. First Graphene says it works by forming a protective gas barrier, preventing the release of volatile compounds prior to ignition, and also a char layer should ignition occur. But graphene is a notoriously enigmatic material and the company says there may be other mechanisms at work, which are not yet fully understood. A spokeswoman says, \"There's no data suggesting that graphene poses any health hazards. The industry continues to test and evaluate these aspects.\" In the UK, Vector Homes is preparing to sell a licence for PureGRAPH to makers of plastic pellets that could be used to make construction materials such as fascia boards. \"It hits the highest ratings in those tests,\" says Liam Britnell, co-founder and chief technology officer. That's why Eric Appel at Stanford University, and colleagues have been working on gel-like fire retardants that could be sprayed onto a home hours before a wildfire reaches it, to limit the damage. Lab work revealed that, upon exposure to a flame, one of the gels he was working on bubbled up to form a porous aerogel structure within it that is highly protective against fire. \"As soon as I saw that it did that, it was like, 'Oh my gosh – that would be perfect for this',\" recalls Prof Appel.",

      "summary_tr_long": "'This is the big one' - tech firms bet on electrifying rail Chris Baraniuk Technology Reporter AFP via Getty Images Diesel locomotives are being replaced with electric models Every day, thousands of passengers heading south west on trains leaving Aldershot station pass a cluster of solar panels nestled by the tracks. \"On a sunny afternoon, if you are catching a train through Aldershot, a little bit of the energy for that train will come from those solar panels,\" says Leo Murray, co-founder and chief executive of Riding Sunbeams, a start-up aiming to use renewable energy resources for rail electrification projects. Riding Sunbeams built the Aldershot array in 2019 . It's small in scale at just 40 kilowatts – equivalent to roughly 10 of the rooftop solar arrays you would find on a typical British home. Not only that, Mr Murray says it is currently the only solar array in the country that delivers power directly to rail to move trains. Around the country, and the world, many trains still run on diesel – a fossil fuel. To go electric, rail operators have traditionally had two options: electrified rail, or overhead lines that that trains connect to with arm-like pantographs on their roofs. But engineers are working on new ways of implementing such technologies and completely different alternatives are also emerging, which could speed up electrification projects. This is why he views solar panels as so useful in enabling railway electrification projects. Mr Murray says that, after the Aldershot project, he had hoped Riding Sunbeams would go on to build a full-scale commercial pilot. Now, however, Network Rail, which owns and maintains railway infrastructure in Great Britain, is seeking suppliers for rail-side renewables projects. \"This is the big one,\" says Mr Murray, explaining that his business is planning to bid for a contract. Riding Sunbeams Leo Murray would like to see more solar panels next to railway tracks New projects bring new complexities, however. At Aldershot, the track was already electrified – it was a case of plugging solar panels in to that existing system. But for trains that are switching off diesel and moving over to overhead lines, leveraging solar is harder. This is because solar panels produce direct current (DC) electricity whereas overhead lines use alternating current (AC). Efforts are underway in England to develop a new converter device that could solve this problem, though. Separately, Colton Junction between Leeds and York, the fastest railway junction in the UK – where trains speed through at up to 125mph – was electrified recently with the help of software developed at the University of Huddersfield. The software makes a 3D model of the overhead line system, allowing engineers to plan its construction in minute detail – lowering costs by removing the need for certain forms of traditional testing and evaluation. \"Everything was specified in the software in terms of measurements,\" says João Pombo, associate director of the university's Institute of Railway Research. \"All the trains are running at maximum speed at that junction since August.\" Nevomo Poland's Nevomo has developed an electromagnetic propulsion system But there are completely different ideas for electrification out there. It's retrofitted onto existing track by fitting a thick aluminium cable into an enclosure that runs between the rails. This generates a magnetic field strong enough to propel freight wagons fitted with magnets. \"We eliminate locomotives completely,\" says Ben Paczek, founder and chief executive. They can also operate in groups.\" A key benefit of the technology, says Mr Paczek, is that it allows operators to bring freight wagons to a stop very quickly – and, as a consequence, that means they could, in principle, safely put lots of independently moving wagons relatively close together on one stretch of rail, increasing the density of freight transportation in a particular area. Nevomo hopes to launch working implementations of its technology at a steel plant in Bremen, Germany, and at a port in India next year. These will be relatively small in scale, each covering track distances of less than 1km (0.6 miles). \"In a quite conservative environment like rail, we need to demonstrate it properly first.\" It would be possible to automate the motion of electromagnetically-propelled wagons, he adds – though initially they will be controlled remotely by human operators. University of Birmingham New railways tech needs to prove there's a business case says Stuart Hillmansen In the US, Parallel Systems is also working on electrifying individual freight wagons so that they can move independently around a rail network – but in a very different way, with batteries. The firm's wagons would have a range of 800km, says co-founder and chief executive Matt Soule. He describes it like moving packets around a distribution centre – \"atomised freight\", and quite unlike traditional locomotive-pulled freight trains that can be more than 2km long . He adds that he does not aim to replace freight locomotives, but rather to offer a rail-based delivery service that could compete with trucking. \"If we simply grab 10% of the trucking market, we've doubled the rail industry,\" he says. Stuart Hillmansen at the University of Birmingham, who has worked with Riding Sunbeams in the past, says organising the movement of individual freight trains on an existing rail network could be \"quite challenging – certainly on [British] railways\". But he says that new technologies are helping to facilitate electrification – and that electrified trains in general are now the \"go-to\" option for new railways. \"All of these technologies are physically feasible and can work, the thing is managing the business case,\" he says.",

Manchester airport said on Christmas Eve it expects around 75,000 passengers passing through, with 208 flights leaving the UK, but that number will halve on Christmas Day. Its most popular destinations on Christmas Eve are Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin. Heathrow meanwhile says it is expecting its busiest December period ever, including 152,000 passengers using it on Christmas Day. EasyJet said 558 flights will depart on Christmas Day, part of \"its busiest festive season ever\". Stansted Airport said Christmas Day for it, meanwhile, will be relatively quiet. The busiest single day of the festive period for air travel was Friday 19 December. Getty Images The RAC meanwhile said particular tight spots on the roads will be the clockwise northern and western sections of the M25 from mid-morning, and the M5 north from Gloucestershire towards the West Midlands later in the afternoon. While millions will travel by rail, earlier last-train times mean many may take to the road, making them even more congested. Several rail routes will be restricted or closed over the Christmas period for maintenance. National Rail trains do not run on Christmas Day and only a small number will run on Boxing Day. National Express coaches says it is running on Christmas day to 96 destinations. The RAC's mobile servicing and repair's team leader Nick Mullender said 2025 was \"looking to be the busiest getaway period since our records began\" in 2013. He said this year's Christmas Eve would be the busiest, with workers saving on annual leave days and heading off on getaways at the last minute. Meanwhile the AA, which provides traffic updates across the UK, said 19 December was the busiest part of the season. For Christmas Eve, it warned the M27 will close in both directions between Junction 9 (Whiteley/Park Gate) and Junction 11 (Fareham East/Gosport) from 8pm until 4am on 4 January for major works at Junction 10. This closure affects road journeys between Southampton and Portsmouth. Drivers are advised to check tyres, expect delays and ensure oil and coolant levels are correct. It expected a rise in breakdowns as the weather becomes colder and 4.2 million journeys will be taken on roads. You can see how weather will affect your Christmas travel plans on the road.

      "summary_tr_long": "BP sells stake in motor oil arm Castrol for $6bn Archie Mitchell Business reporter Getty Images BP has struck a $6bn (£4.4bn) deal to sell a majority stake in its motor oil division Castrol to a US investment firm. The oil giant sold a 65% stake in Castrol, which makes lubricants for cars, motorcycles and industrial vehicles, to New York-based Stonepeak. The deal valued Castrol at $10.1bn (£7.5bn), with BP receiving $6bn in cash, which it will use to pay down debts and allow it to focus on its core business. BP will hold onto a 35% stake in Castrol, which it first took control of in 2000. The London-based oil major said the sale is a \"milestone\" in its plans to overhaul its business and strip out costs. BP in February announced plans to sell off $20bn (£15bn) worth of assets in a bid to focus on its core crude oil and gas business and strengthen its balance sheet. Following today's deal and previous announcements, the company says its over half way to meeting that target. It is also shifting its strategy away from investment in green energy and renewing its focus on oil and gas following pressure from some investors who were frustrated that its profits and share price had lagged behind rivals. Rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's call to \"drill baby drill\" has encouraged firms to invest in fossil fuels. The Castrol sale comes a week after BP unveiled its first female chief executive , Meg O'Neill, who will take the helm in April 2026. Her surprise appointment came only three months after BP appointed a new chairman, Albert Manifold. And she was handed the top job less than two years after Murray Auchincloss took over from Bernard Looney as chief executive. Wednesday's deal is the latest in a series of sales by the firm, which included offloading its US onshore wind energy business and its Dutch mobility and convenience arm. Interim chief executive Carol Howle said the sale is a \"very good outcome for all stakeholders\". \"We are reducing complexity, focusing the downstream on our leading integrated businesses, and accelerating delivery of our plan,\" she added. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the deal was \"an early Christmas present\" for BP shareholders. \"The significant proceeds from the transaction will allow BP to make a decent dent in its onerous borrowings pile. It also means it is well on the way to achieving its goal of $20 billion worth of divestments by 2027,\" he said. Shares in BP opened higher on Wednesday morning on the news, before giving up most of their gains.",

      "summary_tr_long": "US economy grows at fastest pace in two years Natalie Sherman Business reporter Bloomberg via Getty Images The US economy picked up speed over the three months to September, as consumer spending jumped and exports increased. The world's largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.3%, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter. That was better than expected, and marked the strongest growth in two years. The report, which had been delayed by the US government shutdown, sheds light on an economy that has been buffeted by dramatic changes to trade and immigration policies, as well as persistent inflation and cuts to government spending. But while that has led to sharp swings in some areas, such as imports and exports, the underlying economy has maintained solid momentum, outperforming many forecasts. \"This is an economy that has defied doom and gloom expectations basically since the beginning of 2022\", said Aditya Bhave, senior economist at Bank of America. Speaking to the BBC's Business Today programme, Mr Bhave described the economy as \"very very resilient\". \"I don't see why that wouldn't continue going forward,\" he added. The overall growth figure for the third quarter of the year was much stronger than expected, with most analysts expecting an annual pace of about 3.2%. It was lifted by consumer spending that rose at an annual rate of 3.5%, compared with 2.5% in the previous quarter, despite a slowing job market, as households spent more on health care services. Imports - which count against growth - continued to decline, reflecting the wave of taxes on shipments entering the US that President Donald Trump announced this spring. Meanwhile exports, which had dropped sharply, bounced back, surging by 7.4%. Government spending also rebounded, driven by defence outlays. Those gains helped to overcome a slowdown in business investment, including in intellectual property, and a housing market struggling under the weight of still-high interest rates, which have heightened affordability issues and supply constraints. Michael Pearce, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said the economy was well positioned as it headed into 2026, when it will start to feel the boost from tax cuts and the US central bank's recent moves to drop interest rates. \"Underlying measures are consistent with a solid expansion,\" he said. In a post on social media, Trump celebrated the figures, saying his tariffs were responsible. He has been on the defensive amid souring consumer confidence and polls indicating dissatisfaction with his handling of the economy. However, some analysts warned that rising prices faced by some households could make it difficult to sustain the unusually strong pace of growth seen in the most recent quarter. Over the three months to September, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, ticked up 2.8%, compared with 2.1% in the previous quarter, according to the report. Analysts have warned that those price increases are weighing on lower and middle income households, even as higher income households continue to spend freely. Oliver Allen, senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that some more recent surveys and credit card data suggest that households are reining in their spending. \"The weak labour market, stagnant real incomes, and exhaustion of pandemic-era excess savings all seem finally to be catching up with households,\" he said.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Major fires still a risk under 'spineless' new safety law, construction boss warns Getty Images Blocks of flats in Stratford’s East Village were found to fire safety issues, some of which have now been resolved Government plans to turn post-Grenfell fire safety guidance into law have been strongly criticised by a leading voice in the construction industry. David Jones, president of the Institute of Construction Management, says the guidance for multi-storey residential buildings is \"loose\", \"spineless\" and \"open to interpretation\". He argues it permits too many \"tolerable\" risks - for example, allowing flammable materials in window systems and between floors to remain even if they could let fire spread. \"It's allowing developers to game the system,\" the veteran of more than 50 years says, adding that making it law would be an \"absolute abomination\". Mr Jones is the first senior building industry leader to publicly criticise the plans, which are currently out for consultation. The government says the guidelines are a proportionate approach to dealing with the flammable cladding crisis. Ministers insist making them law will bring clarity and certainty to the process of deciding which fire safety defects need addressing. Mr Jones argues the guidance, which the government wants to enshrine into law, permits too many \"tolerable\" fire risks Cladding campaigners say the word \"tolerable\" appears dozens of times in the guidelines, which are known in the industry as PAS 9980. Combustible materials are allowed to remain in place if risks are assessed to be \"tolerable\" - meaning in a standard fire test a blaze does not spread beyond one floor within 15 minutes or two floors within 30 minutes. Mr Jones argues that in the guidance, engineers are not explicitly required to present fire test safety data for these materials, making assessments subjective and open to interpretation. He believes the lack of a ban on materials with \"limited combustibility\" is \"another gaming of the system. It's a fuel, it just burns a little bit slower.\" Part of the government's motivation for tolerating certain risks is to avoid delays caused by disagreements about how much work is needed to make buildings constructed with cladding safe. Progress has been slow in the eight years since the Grenfell tragedy. Ministry of Housing statistics for December show around 475 of the more than 5,500 blocks so far identified as unsafe have been completely fixed and certified as safe in the last 12 months. Cladding has been replaced in 35% of those dangerous blocks since Grenfell - including nearly all of the tallest buildings with the same type of cladding as Grenfell Tower. Residents' representatives fear that any flammable materials left in place can lead to a lower fire safety rating - even after repairs. In turn, this could result in permanently higher building insurance premiums. In a statement, the government said it was up to the insurance industry to bring premiums down once buildings are certified as safe. The insurance industry says if flammable materials remain, it will price the risk accordingly. View Pictures via Getty Images Seven years have passed after the problems at East Village, the Olympic Park development, were discovered Mr Jones also criticises the fact the guidelines only deal with the exterior facades of buildings - covering cladding and insulation issues. Fire safety inspections since Grenfell have revealed many tower blocks also have significant internal fire safety defects. The government has robustly rejected Mr Jones's criticisms. It adds the new law will prevent what it describes as unnecessary work and disturbance for residents. A consultation on the guidance becoming law ends on 31 December, with legislation planned in 2026.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Government waters down inheritance tax plan for farms Kate Whannel, political reporter, Georgia Roberts, Derby political reporter and Joe Pike, politics investigations correspondent PA Media Farmers protested against the changes again at last month's Budget Government proposals to tax inherited farmland have been watered down, with the planned threshold increasing from £1m to £2.5m. The climbdown follows months of protests by farmers and concern from some Labour backbenchers. At last year's Budget, ministers said they would start imposing a 20% tax on inherited agricultural assets worth more than £1m from April 2026, ending the 100% tax relief that had been in place since the 1980s. In an announcement put out after MPs had left Parliament for the Christmas recess, Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds said: \"We have listened closely to farmers across the country and we are making changes today to protect more ordinary family farms.\" \"It's only right that larger estates contribute more, while we back the farms and trading businesses that are the backbone of Britain's rural communities, \" she said. Head of the National Farmers' Union Tom Bradshaw welcomed the change, telling BBC Radio 5 Live it \"takes out many family farms from the eye of a pernicious storm\". Gavin Lane, president of the Country Land and Business Association, said: \"The government deserves credit for recognising the flaws in the original policy and changing course. \"However, this announcement only limits the damage - it doesn't eradicate it entirely. \"Many family businesses will own enough expensive machinery and land to be valued above the threshold, yet still operate on such narrow profit margins that this tax burden remains unaffordable.\" Ben Ardern, a farmer from Derbyshire, told the BBC said it was \"a step in the right direction\". He said the government should \"drop it [the tax] for family farms... and just tax the people who have got the money to tax. \"The big corporations who have just buried money into land - they're not farmers, they have just done it to avoid tax. Farmers haven't bought land to avoid tax, we've bought land to farm it and grow food.\" Ben Ardern, a third generation beef and dairy farmer from Buxton, has organised protests against the tax In the 14 months since the initial proposal was announced, there have been regular protests by farmers outside Parliament. Some Labour MPs in rural areas have also expressed concern. At a recent parliamentary vote on the plan, a dozen backbenchers abstained and one, Markus Campbell-Savours, voted against. Campbell-Savours was subsequently suspended for voting against the government, meaning he now sits as an independent MP. John Whitby, a Labour MP from the Rural Research Group of backbenchers, said the government's climbdown on inheritance tax was \"fantastic news\". But one Labour source described the timing of the change as \"bizarre\". They added that many MPs would be annoyed as \"they were made to vote for it so recently\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said in a post on social media: \"This fight isn't finished. \"Other family businesses are still affected by Labour's tax raid, and we will keep pushing until the tax is lifted from them too.\" Liberal Democrat spokesperson Tim Farron MP said: \"It is utterly inexcusable that family farmers have been put through over a year of uncertainty and anguish since the government first announced these changes. \"We demand that the government scraps this unfair tax in full and if they refuse to, Liberal Democrats will submit amendments in the new year to bring it down.\" Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice said: \"This cynical climbdown - whilst better than nothing - does little to address the year of anxiety that farmers have faced in planning to protect their livelihoods... with British agriculture hanging by a thread, the government must go further and abolish this callous farms tax.\" In her first Budget in 2024, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced she would be reversing the 100% inheritance tax relief on agricultural assets that had been in place since the 1980s. The move would have seen inherited agricultural assets worth over £1m taxed at 20%, half the standard inheritance tax rate, raising an estimated £520m annually by 2029. The government had argued that the change would protect smaller farms while stopping wealthy investors from buying farmland as a tax loophole. However, it has now stepped back from the original proposal raising the threshold level to £2.5m. Coupled with an exemption which allows farmers to pass on assets to their spouses tax-free, this new government concession means a couple could pass on up to £5m in qualifying assets, without paying tax. Above the threshold, a 50% relief will be applied to the remaining assets. According to the government, the number of estates in the UK expected to pay more inheritance tax in 2026/27 will be reduced from around 2,000 under the original plans to 1,100 under the new proposal. A Treasury source said changing the thresholds would cost the government £130m, but that there were \"no plans\" for the policy to be scrapped entirely. \"The principle of reforming the tax system remains,\" the source said. \"It's right that the wealthiest estates pay their fair share, but smaller farms will get help.\" The climbdown is the latest in a series of U-turns the government has made since being elected in July 2024. Earlier this year the government eased cuts to winter fuel payments and backtracked on plans to make £5bn of cuts to the welfare bill.",

Her total earnings jumped by more than two thirds from almost £158m a year earlier , despite profits at the gambling firm tumbling. Ms Coates was awarded £104m in salary in the year to March 2025, Companies House filings show. In addition, as a majority shareholder in Bet365, she was entitled to at least half of the £354m dividend payment declared by the firm for the year. The £280m package means she has earned more than £2bn from Bet365 over the past decade. Campaign group the High Pay Centre condemned Ms Coates's pay as too high. Director Andrew Speke said: \"Denise Coates is well-liked in Stoke for being self-made and giving back to her community. \"But the eye-watering sums she earns go far beyond what anyone needs for a life of luxury - and her fortune comes from an industry that has caused real harm to too many people.\" Bet365 has been approached for comment. Her latest pay deal came as Bet365's pre-tax profit fell to £339m for the year, from £596m previously. Overall revenue rose by 9%, from £3.7bn a year earlier to £4bn. Ms Coates founded Bet365 in a portable building in a Stoke-on-Trent car park more than 20 years ago. It is now the biggest private sector employer in the city and offers sports betting, poker, casino games and bingo online to millions of customers worldwide. She is one of Britain's richest women and among the world's highest-paid executives. After training as an accountant, Ms Coates helped build Bet365 into one of the biggest online gambling companies from her father's bookmaking business. Her brother, John Coates, is a co-chief executive of the company. As well as being one of the UK's best-paid bosses, Ms Coates is reportedly among the country's biggest taxpayers . Her £104m salary would see her pay tens of millions in income tax and national insurance. Bet365 also said the company paid £482m of tax in the year to March, up from £364m a year earlier, including tax on dividend payments. During the year, Bet365 donated £130m to the Denise Coates Foundation, which donates to charities covering education, arts and culture and health.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Our son can't come home for Christmas after insulation mould took over Zoe Conway News Correspondent The Wadleys tell the BBC of the ongoing impact of problems with the insulation Tony and Becs Wadley say they can't spend Christmas at home after insulation installed under a government scheme has caused black mould in several rooms, and their asthmatic son can't be inside the property. Elliott can't come into our house, it's as if he's been ostracised from his own home.'' The couple are among more than 300 people who have contacted the BBC in recent weeks to tell us about insulation that has gone wrong in their homes. The Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said it was taking action to ensure consumers are no longer let down by poor installations. It spread under internal wall insulation which was installed in 2024. Mr and Mrs Wadley got a government grant to have energy efficiency measures fitted in their Gower Peninsula house because they hoped a warmer home would help Elliott's asthma. But months after the work was completed, the Wadleys discovered black mould was growing behind the insulation boards. Elliott, 19, hasn't entered the house since April, instead staying with his grandmother during university breaks. Billions of pounds of public money has been spent on insulating homes over the last 15 years. The Wadleys' home was insulated under a government scheme known as ECO4. In October, the National Audit Office (NAO) spending watchdog found that 98% of homes fitted with external wall insulation under ECO4 and the Great British Insulation Scheme since 2022 had major issues that needed to be repaired. It added that 29% of homes that had internal wall insulation fitted under the schemes had major issues. DESNZ said it had \"inherited a flawed system of oversight and regulation\". A spokesman for the department said it was \"committed to introducing comprehensive reforms through the Warm Homes Plan to ensure that consumers get the quality installations they deserve and failures like these are not repeated\". The spokesman added: \"People should not be expected to navigate a complex web of organisations when they want to improve their homes – and with this government, they won't.\" Becs Wadley Becs and Tony Wadley with their three sons Felix, Freddie and Elliott. The installer, Stellar Energy, says it has ''no record of any immediate safety hazards being flagged.'' It says the descriptions of the exposed wires and sockets was \"highly inconsistent\" with their standard operating procedures, which required all such work to be made safe. Building surveyor, David Walter, says the insulation wasn't fitted correctly and says the installer ''didn't understand what they were doing and what they were doing to the building which is why we've got these problems.'' Stellar Energy told the BBC the design was ''technically correct for a stone house and was installed...in strict accordance with the mandatory technical specifications of ECO4.'' Mr Wadley says he wouldn't have signed up for the grant if he'd known what would happen. Somebody needs to take responsibility.'' Stellar Energy says it ''sincerely regrets any distress this situation has caused the family'' and says its priority is ''providing a final resolution to ensure the home meets the high standards'' it strives for. Scott Proudman had external wall insulation fitted to his family's home in 2021 under a government scheme. He is facing a £20,000 bill to get it replaced. Scott Proudman contacted the BBC about the botched external wall insulation fitted to his Bristol home in 2021. His family had been eligible for a government grant because of his eight-year-old daughter's disabilities. Born 24 weeks premature, she has cerebral palsy, a partial visual impairment and was recently diagnosed with autism. When the work was done, insulation boards were fixed to the outside of the house and render was applied to make it waterproof. As a result, the insulation underneath it is no longer waterproof and damp and mould could grow inside the house. Building surveyor Mr Walter, says poor design and poor workmanship has caused the render to disintegrate. He says rainwater will very likely get under the cracked render and behind the insulation and will likely cause dampness inside. Mr Walter says all of the render and insulation will have to come off and will cost tens of thousands of pounds to put right. Right now the family is stuck with the repair bill because the installer, SPMS Wales, is being liquidated and Mr Proudman says they weren't given the required guarantee for the work. Trustmark, the organisation responsible for overseeing quality, told Mr Proudman it couldn't help because the company is no longer accredited. Mr Proudman says he chose the company ''because it was on a government website and was Trustmark registered. I can't believe how few rights consumers have.'' Brett Langdon, a director at SPMS Wales says he is ''very sorry the Proudmans have ended up in this situation'' and says all works ''were done to the manufactures specification.'' He says he gave a guarantee to the Proudmans but has told the BBC he can't remember who the guarantee is with. In a statement TrustMark said it was ''very sorry to hear about what's happened to Mr and Mrs Proudman and Mr and Mrs Wadley and the conditions both families' homes have been left in. It is totally unacceptable and we are in discussions with the relevant Scheme Providers and guarantee providers to help resolve these situations.'' And it said it underlined ''the need for reform to the current system''.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Who are the frontrunners for the top Fed job? Danielle Kaye Business reporter Reuters The high-stakes search for a new leader of the US central bank is drawing to a close. US President Donald Trump is expected to name someone in the coming weeks to replace Jerome Powell, whose term as Federal Reserve chairman will end in May. That person will step into the role at a tricky moment. The bank is contending with both political pressure and internal disagreement about how it should set interest rates in the months ahead. Credibility concerns could make the job even harder. Trump has made clear he wants lower borrowing costs and put unusual pressure on the Fed, raising questions about whether whoever wins the post will act independently. Trump's nominee would then go to the Senate for confirmation. Here's what to know about the frontrunners. Kevin Hassett, a Trump loyalist Reuters Kevin Hassett, a long-time conservative economist and key Trump economic adviser, is seen as a top contender to succeed Powell. A Trump loyalist, Hassett, 63, served as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during Trump's first term and now leads the National Economic Council. His odds of clinching the role have dropped since early December, but Wall Street traders still deem him the most likely choice. Hassett has been a stalwart defender of Trump's economic policies, downplaying data showing signs of weakness in the US economy and repeating allegations of bias at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. His allegiance to the president has drawn questions from analysts about whether he would act independently at the Fed and how much sway he would have with other members of the board. In a research note, Deutsche Bank economists wrote that Hassett might struggle, at least initially, to convince other policymakers to put aside concerns about inflation and cut rates meaningfully. \"Other officials might be sceptical of forward-looking arguments that rely heavily on the administration's policies bringing inflation closer to target,\" they wrote. Even some within the Trump administration have reportedly questioned whether Hassett has the skills needed to effectively take the helm of the central bank. Hassett addressed those questions in a CNBC interview this month, saying that the Fed's independence was \"really, really important\", while reiterating that interest rates still had room to fall. \"The way you've got to drive interest-rate movements is with consensus based on the facts and the data,\" he said. Kevin Warsh, a Fed critic Bloomberg via Getty Images Kevin Warsh, who served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, has re-emerged in recent weeks as another potential pick. The 55 year-old economist, a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution who serves on the board of UPS, had also been considered for Fed chair during Trump's first term. He briefly overtook Hassett in prediction markets this month before falling back to second place. \"I think the two Kevins are great,\" Trump told the Wall Street Journal this month. Warsh has been an outspoken Fed critic, lambasting everything from the central bank's heavy reliance on data to its use of assets on its balance sheet. He has escalated his rhetoric since emerging as a contender for the top Fed job this year, calling for \"regime change\". Warsh had a relatively \"hawkish\" reputation as Fed governor, meaning that he tended to favour higher interest rates and focused on concerns about inflation. But he is now seen as a voice that would support lower rates in the near term. He has argued that the Fed should shrink its balance sheet in order to bring down short-term interest rates, though some have questioned that logic. \"He thinks you have to lower interest rates,\" Trump told the Journal. \"And so does everybody else that I've talked to.\" Warsh also has close family connections to Trump's orbit. His father-in-law, billionaire businessman Ronald Lauder, is a longtime Trump donor and ally. Christopher Waller, an Fed insider Bloomberg via Getty Images Christopher Waller, a current Fed governor, recently met with Trump for an interview, boosting his chances for the job in prediction markets. He was nominated to the Fed's board by Trump in 2020 and has recently stressed that the Fed has room to lower interest rates even further. Waller, 66, lacks the personal ties that could help propel Hassett and Warsh to the top of Trump's list. Wall Street, however, has looked favourably upon his relative distance from the White House. Trump, when asked about Waller following their meeting, called him \"great\", adding that \"he's a man who's been there a long time\". While the two Kevins remain the favourites, Waller is emerging as \"the more sensible choice\", said Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital. He noted that choosing Waller could open up two spots on the Fed board for Trump to fill next year, since Fed governor Stephen Miran's term is set to end. It remains to be seen who will satisfy the president. Other names floated include BlackRock executive Rick Reider and even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. In the end, no matter who emerges the winner from this contest, it may be Wall Street that serves as final judge of their success.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Why Croatia's capital wants to hold Europe's best Christmas market Guy Delauney Balkans correspondent AFP via Getty Images Zagreb's Christmas market was voted the best in Europe three years in a row Christmas markets are not just tradition across Europe, they are big businesses that give cities a huge economic boost every December. For Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, it is an effective way of attracting tourists outside of the country's main summer season. The words \"tourism\" and \"Croatia\" are likely to conjure visons of sparkling Adriatic vistas during the hottest months of the year. Tourism accounts for more than a fifth of the economy of this Balkan country, and it is keen to encourage more visitors to arrive outside of the height of summer. At some point way back it was just sun and sea, but now Croatia offers many tourism products all across the country.\" Zagreb Advent, as the capital's Christmas markets and events are collectively known, is the poster child for this approach, with billboards in neighbouring countries urging people to attend. While some cities might limit their offering to a single location, Zagreb Advent is a multi-venue spectacular that takes over large chunks of the centre. \"The entire city has become a festive ground for celebrating Christmas throughout the whole of December,\" says Slavica Olujic Klapcic, who manages one of the Christmas market areas. \"What's really special around here is that each of the locations has its own theme, and it's a little bit different in decoration, and in the content that it offers. So for a visitor, I think it's a good deal, because by taking a walk through Zagreb, you can see many different spots.\" Like other Christmas markets across Europe there are no shortages of the usual seasonal staples, such as sausages and mulled wine. But there are also multiple music stages, craft stalls, vendors offering traditional Croatian food, art installations, and an enormous ice rink. Slavica Olujic Klapcic, who manages one of the market areas, says that Zagreb offers festive variety \"It brings life to Zagreb,\" reckons Zrinka Farina, who is involved with putting on Christmas market events outside the city's historic Hotel Esplanade, as well as a food and music market at nearby Strossmayer Square called Fuliranje – which roughly translates as \"fooling around\". \"We are such a sporty nation, we love to compete – and when we do something, we really want to be the best in the world in it.\" Such has been the effort that the city has put into Zagreb Advent since it was first held in 2014 that it was voted the best Christmas market in Europe for three years in a row , from 2015 to 2017. The competition is organised by travel website European Best Destinations, and Zagreb's success has helped to drive visitor numbers to the city every December. Back in 2014, the city saw 100,198 people stay for at least one night during the last month of the year. By 2024 this had more than doubled to 245,352, which the tourist board says gave the city a €100m ($117m; £88m) economic boost. The Zagreb Advent event is spread across the centre of the city However, Zagreb has a long way to go if it wishes to catch up with Europe's Christmas market heavyweights. It is expected to attract four million visitors this year, with an economic impact of €229m. Meanwhile, Austria's capital Vienna attracts around 2.8 million visitors to its Christmas market, and France's Strasbourg gets two million people. Zagreb's event also has a limited history – it is only in its 11th year. By contrast, Dresden's Christmas market, widely considered to be the world's oldest, was first held in 1434. Strasbourg's began in 1570, Vienna in 1764 and Cologne in 1820. \"They come here from Italy, Spain, Bosnia, Slovenia and even the UK,\" says Lucija Vrkljan, who is working as a steward at the ice rink. \"It's a great place to be,\" says Dario Kozul, the founder of BioMania, a bistro with a stall offering vegan and gluten-free food at the Hotel Esplanade Christmas market. Then we talk about our restaurant, and within the next couple of days, we see them there.\" AFP via Getty Images Dresden's Christmas market was first held in 1434 Marko Peric, dean of the Faculty of Tourism at Croatia's University of Rijeka, agrees that Zagreb Advent brings \"unusually high\" numbers of arrivals and overnight stays in December. But he cautions that the rest of Croatia's heavy reliance on the summer season is a weakness that still needs to be addressed. And we could use other types of events like carnival in February, or sporting events.\" Tourism Minister Tonci Glavina insists that Croatia is making moves in the right direction. He points out that visitor numbers over July and August were actually slightly down on the same period in 2024. But the country is still on course for a record-breaking year, thanks to significant growth either side of the summer peak, with around 5% more arrivals in June and September. This, says the minister, is \"just perfect\", as is the 10% year-on-year rise over the first week of December. \"We are transforming Croatia to be a sustainable tourism destination, meaning about the same number of guests in peak season, developing the shoulder seasons, and of course developing other parts of the country to be main tourism destinations.\" Zagreb Advent has already shown the benefits. Although that may not be the first thing that springs to a visitor's mind with all the traditional Croatian treats on offer.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Megan Lawton Business reporter AFP via Getty Images One UK study found that 34% of advertised vacancies didn't really exist The phrase \"ghost jobs\" might sound like something from Halloween, but it refers to the practice of employers advertising vacancies that don't exist. In some cases the positions may have already been filled, but in others the job might not have ever been available. Up to 22% of jobs advertised online last year were positions listed with no intent to hire, according to a study across the US, UK and Germany by recruitment software provider Greenhouse. A separate UK study put the figure even higher, at 34%. Meanwhile, the most recent official data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that while there were 7.2 million job vacancies back in August, only 5.1 million people were hired. Why are firms posting ghost jobs, and what is being done to tackle the problem? In the US, a jobhunting tech worker called Eric Thompson is making politicians in Washington DC increasingly aware of the issue. In October of last year Mr Thompson, who has more than 20 years of experience in the tech sector, was made redundant from a start-up. He spent the following two months unsuccessfully applying for hundreds of jobs. It dawned on Mr Thompson that some of the advertised jobs simply didn't exist. The experience led him to set up a working group calling for legislation to ban the practice of fake job adverts in the US. Continuing to meet with members of the US Congress, he has led the formulation of proposed legislation called The Truth in Job Advertising & Accountability Act. This calls for expiration dates for listings when hiring is paused or completed, auditable hiring records, and penalties for employers who post misleading or non-existent roles. He has also started a petition, which has so far generated over 50,000 signatures. Alongside the signatures, he says he receives messages from people describing how ghost jobs have chipped away at their confidence and impacted their mental health. The New Jersey and California state legislatures are also looking at banning ghost jobs. Eric Thompson Eric Thompson wants US politicians to ban ghost jobs The Canadian province of Ontario, is however, leading the way. As from 1 January companies will have to disclose whether an advertised vacancy is actively being filled. Ontario is also moving to tackle the separate recruitment issue of \"ghosting\", whereby companies don't reply to applicants. Firms in the province with more than 25 employees will now have to reply to someone they have interviewed within 45 days. However, they still won't need to contact anyone they didn't choose to interview. Deborah Hudson, an employment lawyer based in Toronto, says she's already been approached by companies \"trying to get it right\". \"My cynical side, after almost 20 years in this field, wonders how they're actually going to monitor and regulate this. But if people run into problems, they can make a complaint and it will be looked into.\" Elsewhere in Canada, and in the US and UK, there is no legal requirement to reply to candidates. Nor are there any current moves in the UK to tackle either ghost jobs or recruitment ghosting. Ailish Davies, a jobseeker from Leicester in the UK, says that being ghosted by small firms and big corporations alike is \"soul destroying\". She adds: \"The amount of time I've spent putting effort into tailoring an application, to hear nothing back, it knocks you down.\" Ms Davies, who has been working in marketing for more than 10 years, describes one occasion where a hiring manager asked for her availability for an interview, and after she replied, she never heard back. \"Employers should treat job seekers with more compassion because the current job market is not a nice place to be.\" Jasmine Escalera is a career coach and recruitment expert based in Miami. \"They kept seeing the same job posted again and again, and asking me if they should reapply. The morale of any job seeker gets crushed.\" newNsight Photography Jasmine Escalera says that some firms may be trying to pretend that they are growing So why are companies posting ghost jobs? \"We surveyed hiring managers, and found some companies post positions to create a talent pool,\" she says. \"It isn't that they don't want to hire, it's more they're not hiring immediately. \"Others, we found, were inflating numbers and trying to show their company is growing, even if it's not.\" Dr Escalera adds that she has also heard examples of companies posting jobs to obtain and sell data. Whatever the reason for the fake adverts, Dr Escalera cautions that it is giving governments a false picture of job markets, which has negative, real-world consequences. \"We use data to develop policy and understand what market trends look like, and so if that data is somehow skewed, then we're not able to create the policies or provide the support that job seekers and employees need right now,\" she says. For jobhunters hoping to avoid ghost jobs, Dr Escalera advises that they try to network with hiring managers. \"You will know a position is real if you're having conversations with real humans who work at that organisation,\" she says. \"If you see that a job is being posted multiple times during a certain time frame, or that the job posting has been open for a while, then it is possible the posting is staying open because the job is not intended to be filled.\" Read more global business stories",

      "summary_tr_long": "Why this month's inflation figure may be good news for you Kevin Peachey Cost of living correspondent Getty Images On the face of it, there is relatively little festive cheer for your finances in the latest inflation figures. Prices have risen by 3.2% compared with a year ago. If you filled your virtual shopping bag with goods and services at a cost of £100 a year ago, the same selection will now cost £103.20. The rate of rising prices is well above the Bank of England's target of 2%, and some items are still rocketing up in price. Chocolate, arguably central to the family diet at Christmas, is 17% more expensive than a year ago. But, crucially, there are now clear signs that prices are going up at a slower rate. That bodes well for next year, and more immediately for the cost of borrowing. And, with essentials driving the slowdown, the latest data will be welcomed by those who feel particularly stretched by the cost of living. Pasta, sugar and flour prices fall The rate of inflation, which charts the rising cost of living, has overcome its recent mini-peak, according to analysts. The mountainous height of inflation was in October 2022 when the rate hit 11.1%. The rate then fell, but there was an uptick in the late summer of 2025, reaching 3.8%. And it was the price of food - an essential for consumers - driving November's drop in inflation. Food and non-alcoholic drinks rose by 4.2% in the year to November, compared to 4.9% in October. Alcohol and tobacco were up 4% compared to 5.9% in October. Moving in the opposite direction to chocolate, and beef and veal (which rose by nearly 28% in a year), were olive oil (down 16%) as well as drops in price for flours, pasta and sugar. Importantly, food is essential spending. When the price rises slow, this is much better news for those on lower incomes who see a bigger proportion of their income spent on things that it is impossible to do without. Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said this was also helping the overall inflation rate drop faster than expected: \"It has been following the path the Bank of England had forecast - peaking in September and gradually moving south.\" Will the good news last? The reasons for slowing price rises are often specific to individual items. For example, the drop in the price of olive oil is primarily the result of a recovery in harvests after some particularly bad years of heatwaves and drought in Greece and Turkey. Clothing and footwear prices fell by 0.6% in the year to November compared to a rise of 0.3% in October. This has been linked to shops bringing forward Black Friday discounts due to weak sales as shoppers struggle with the cost of living pressures. Lucy says home bakers are making the most of what they have Consumers, too, have changed their habits owing to the financial climate of recent years. Lucy Fairs, who helps run a cake-sharing social club, called Band of Bakers in Camberwell, London, said that, over the last five years, they had started using what they already had in their cupboards, rather than buying extra special ingredients. Costa Christou says he chooses recipes carefully \"When I chose a recipe for today, I thought of the theme - but, more so, I thought of what I already had in my pantry,\" said club member Costa Christou. Impact on borrowing and saving The rising cost of goods and services has an impact on the money you save or earn. Inflation erodes the spending power of money you've got saved and - unless you get a pay rise - of your salary. Analysts say the latest inflation data strengthens the likelihood of a cut in interest rates by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee on Thursday. That should make it cheaper for consumers to borrow money, but bring lower returns for savers. \"Lower inflation is good news for household budgets, but it is a different story for savers,\" said Sally Conway, savings commentator at Shawbrook Bank. \"Some savings will inevitably take a hit over Christmas. Once the dust settles, it's worth checking whether remaining cash is working hard enough.\" Policymakers are trying to encourage more people to invest their money in stocks and shares - which they say is likely to bring higher returns over time than cash savings. It is why the Financial Conduct Authority has given the go-ahead for targeted support - a scheme that, for the first time, allows banks and financial firms to give suggestions about where to invest your money.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Spain's commitment to renewable energy may be in doubt Guy Hedgecoe Aragón, north-eastern Spain Juan Antonio Domínguez Spain gets more than half of its electricity from wind and solar On the edge of the sleepy town of Figueruelas, a single, vast wind turbine spins around, casting its shadow over the buildings nearby. It's a reminder of the importance of renewable electricity in this windswept area of Aragón, in north-eastern Spain, whose plains are host to many of the country's wind and solar energy farms. Figueruela's status as a symbol of Spain's green transition has been further boosted recently, as work starts nearby on the construction of a vast factory that will produce batteries for electric vehicles. Chinese firm CATL and the Netherlands-based Stellantis are investing a combined €4bn ($4.7bn; £3.5bn) in the facility. Yao Jing, China's ambassador in Spain, described it as \"one of the biggest Chinese investments Europe has ever seen\". \"We're in Aragón, where there's wind all year round, there are lots of hours of sunshine, and we are surrounded by wind turbines and solar panels,\" he says. \"Those [energy sources] will be crucial in generating electricity for the new factory, and I understand that was the key reason for building it here in Figueruelas.\" Luis Bertol Moreno says the new battery factory will transform the town of Figueruelas The factory can be seen as vindication of Spain's energy model, which prioritises renewable sources. In 2017, renewables contributed just a third of Spain's electricity production, but last year they represented 57%. By 2030, the government wants them to contribute 81% of electricity output. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez summarised his government's approach as he delivered a riposte to US President Donald Trump's pro-fossil fuel \"Dig, baby, dig\" slogan. This was in great part due to an 28 April blackout that left homes, businesses, government buildings, public transport, schools and universities in the dark across Spain and neighbouring Portugal for several hours. With the government unable to offer a full explanation for the outage, the country's energy mix became a fiercely-debated political issue. Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the conservative opposition, accused the government of \"fanaticism\" in pursuing its green agenda, suggesting that an over-reliance on renewables might have caused the incident. The fact that, a week before the blackout, solar generation in mainland Spain registered a record 61.5% of the electricity mix has fuelled such claims. Yet the government and national grid operator Red Eléctrica have both denied that the outage was linked to the preponderance of renewable energy sources in Spain. \"We have operated the system with higher renewable rates [previously] with no effect on the security of the system,\" says Concha Sánchez, head of operations for Red Eléctrica. \"Definitely it's not a question of the rate of renewables at that moment.\" Ms Sánchez said the blackout was caused by a combination of issues, including an \"unknown event\" in the system moments before, which saw anomalous voltage oscillations. However, Red Eléctrica and the government are still awaiting reports on the incident that they hope will determine the exact cause. Meanwhile, since April, Spain's electricity mix has been modified somewhat, with greater reliance on natural gas, reinforcing the notion that the country is at an energy crossroads. AFP via Getty Images Work on the new battery factory was officially started last month, accompanied by a press conference Spain's nuclear industry, which currently contributes around 20% of national electricity, has been particularly vocal since the blackout, pushing back against government plans to close the country's five nuclear plants between 2027 and 2035. With many European countries undergoing a nuclear renaissance, the planned closures make Spain something of an outlier. The companies that own the Almaraz plant in south-western Spain, due to be the first to shut down, have requested a three-year extension to its life until 2030. Ignacio Araluce, president of Foro Nuclear, an association that represents the industry, says Spain is the only country in the world that is scheduling the closure of nuclear plants that are in operation. Mr Araluce praises renewable sources because they only require natural elements to generate electricity, but points out that they are not able to operate around the clock or when weather is unfavourable. The answer, he added, is \"with a source like nuclear, that is not producing CO2, that is producing all hours of the year\". The far-right Vox, criticising what it saw as a lack of explanation by the government for the April blackout, recently described nuclear power as \"a crucial source of stability\". AFP via Getty Images The current government is committed to closing the country's five nuclear power plants Ms Sánchez acknowledges that there is room for improvement for Spain's electricity model, pointing to the Iberian peninsula's relative isolation from the European grid compared to most of its EU neighbours. \"While we have taken a good path when it comes to renewable installation, we cannot say the same regarding storage,\" she says. \"We need to foster storage installation.\" Spain's political panorama adds an element of uncertainty to its energy future. The Socialist-led coalition has been mired in corruption scandals and its parliamentary majority appears to have collapsed in recent weeks, raising the possibility of a snap election in the coming months. The town's population, of just 1,000, is due to increase dramatically, with 2,000 Chinese workers scheduled to arrive to help build the new battery plant, which is expected to create up to 35,000 indirect jobs once it starts operating. \"These kinds of investments revitalise the area, they revitalise the construction sector, hostelry,\" says local man Manuel Martín.",

      "summary_tr_long": "How to get rid of unwanted Christmas presents - without being found out Richard Wilson Dawn-Maria France is an advocate for regifting and says it's the perfect way to declutter her home Most of us have received at least one Christmas present that missed the mark - a jumper that doesn't fit, a hideous ornament or a perfume you don't like. Not every present is greeted with delight - so instead of banishing them to the back of a cupboard, how can you get rid of them without causing offence? Regift Getty Images For Dawn-Maria France from North Yorkshire, the solution to unwanted gifts is simple - pass them on to someone else. She never feels any guilt for doing so and believes it is a more sustainable way of celebrating the festive season. \"It's a budget-friendly way to manage spending, especially during the cost-of-living crisis, and it's helped me declutter my home,\" she adds. Each year, an estimated £42m worth of unwanted presents are thrown away in the UK, with some ending up in landfill. Dawn-Maria re-wrapped her garden seeds adding a personalised note hinting that it was a regift. Hide the evidence Antoinette Akanji The original gifter mustn't risk crossing paths with the new recipient of the gift, says etiquette expert Antoinette Akanji's So how do you regift without causing offence? \"Don't get caught out,\" warns Louise Minchin, who presents the BBC's Rip Off Britain programme, advising regifters to remove any labels or notes that might be addressed to someone else. Before re-wrapping she recommends inspecting the gift carefully to make sure no seals have been broken or show signs of wear. If it's been opened or is part of an incomplete set, it's a clear giveaway the item isn't new. \"I've been caught out,\" admits BBC Radio 2's Reverend Kate Bottley who forgot to check there wasn't a card inside a gift she passed on. The BBC's Morning Live regular Dr Oscar remembers being handed a box of chocolates with the message \"Dear Mrs Smith, Thanks for being my teacher this year\". Etiquette expert Antoinette Akanji's has another golden rule: regift outside your social circle. \"If your aunt has given you a jumper that you didn't like, do not regift this to your cousin,\" she says. \"She may see your cousin wearing it and this could provoke an awkward conversation.\" \"You need to ensure that the original giver and the new recipient aren't likely to cross paths.\" 3. Resell Kirsty Quinn Kirsty Quinn, 36 from Oxfordshire says she makes about £500 a month reselling items sourced from car boot sales and charity shops on eBay and Vinted. \"I think if you receive a gift that you're not going to use or don't like, and it's likely to just sit in a drawer or even end up in landfill, then I don't see the harm in re-gifting...or selling it online,\" she says. \"Selling unwanted gifts can help someone else get something they want at a cheaper price, which feels especially relevant given how tough the economy is at the moment,\" she adds. \"It also means the seller can put that money towards something they actually need, something that improves their life, or something they'll truly use. To me, that feels more practical and sustainable than letting items go to waste.\" Vinted says the first Sunday of each year sees a spike in listings of unwanted gifts - averaging three times the normal daily rate Last year's top-listed items women's toiletries and perfumes, jewellery, nightwear and make-up, according to the platform. Fashion dominated the most-bought items after Christmas closely followed by entertainment and electronics, Vinted says. Vinted's tips for reselling presents without offending the person who bought them include using a username that is not easily identifiable and keeping the background of photos neutral. \"Many members will however choose to regift openly, and will include phrases like 'unwanted gift' in their item description,\" a Vinted spokesperson says. \"This often helps buyers better understand the condition of the item.\" 4. Donate Getty Images If regifting doesn't feel right there are plenty of other ways to pass on the joy, says Louise. Charity shops eagerly await the post-christmas clear-out, when unwanted gifts become someone else's treasure. This is also echoed by Allison Swaine-Hughes, retail director at the British Heart Foundation. \"If you have decorations that didn't quite fit your theme, a board game you've been gifted twice, or a Christmas jumper that's no longer your colour, why not let them brighten someone else's home or wardrobe by donating them to us?\" And it's not about just donating - shopping in charity shops over Christmas can make a difference too. \"Our stores are full of unexpected treasures - quality items just waiting to find loving new homes,\" she says. If you're worried a relative might stumble across the item they'd bought you while they bargain hunt you can always donate to a charity shop outside of your local area. Include a gift receipt If you're the one giving the present, you can make life easier for the recipient if you include a receipt. \"If you're giving someone a gift and include a gift receipt, it gives them far more options,\" explains Louise, especially when the item is high-value. In some cases, a refund may be offered, but that depends on the retailer's individual policy. Without a receipt, things can quickly become uncomfortable, so Louise recommends an honesty first policy: \"Don't be afraid to say, 'I'm really sorry, but I'd like to exchange this for something else do you have the original receipt?'\" Other stories you may enjoy",

The Grace Trust which helps between 700 to 750 people a year struggling with poverty, loneliness or addiction issues said it was seeing \"a much wider range\" of people from all layers of society, including more older people needing community support. General manager Vinni Jones said the charity aimed to put a smile on people's faces from its drop-in base at Lewis Street in St Helier. It helped 500 people at the food bank every year and also ran singing, art and Saturday lunches. 'Just come down' He said there were extra festive goodies at the food bank and 92 people recently sat down to an \"absolutely brilliant\" Christmas meal at St Paul's Centre with 20 volunteers on hand to help out. Entertainment was provided by Fiddler's Green and the trust's Parklife choir. Mr Jones said they saw more people at Christmas because it can be a challenging time. \"Just come down, knock on the window and we'll give you what we've got.\" 'Offer understanding' He explained that \"we can offer a lot more than simply the food and Christmas goodies\" and said people are often surprised at all the activities on offer and encouraged them to have a go. He said the charity also had a fund to help younger mums and links with other agencies so it can offer toy vouchers at Christmas. Support was also available year round for struggling islanders. \"It's just a matter of being able to offer that understanding and to talk about January, talk about February for them. We'll still be here for you,\" Mr Jones said. The government has also reminded islanders about mental health support over Christmas.

The Big Food Project redistributes surplus food from supermarkets and manufacturers to 125 food banks, schools, community kitchens, crisis services and families across Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre. It sends out enough food for about 900,000 meals a year , its founder Neil Reid has said, but needed \"people to volunteer food and cold, hard cash\" for it to keep going.

      "summary_tr_long": "Budget 2025: What's the best and worst that could happen for Labour? Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC Any big red box moment is risky. The prime minister will revel in the argument for scrapping the cap in a big speech on Monday, suggesting it's not just the right thing to do for those in need, but the right move for the economy now and into the future. In other words, giving Labour MPs something many of them - not just the left-wing fringe, but government ministers like Bridget Phillipson - had argued for, has cheered them right up after months of unhappiness and anxiety-fuelled conversations about what Keir Starmer stands for and whether he is up to the job. But with a majority as big as they won in July 2024, it's solving a problem they ought never to have had. From a political point of view, another government source says \"there'll be a body language change and we are going to enjoy the fight.\" If - and it is still an if - this calm can last, politics can settle down and businesses might feel more confident. But for one member of the government, the best-case scenario \"has to be an uptick in the polls and a stronger message for May\", referring to a mega set of elections in Scotland, Wales and across different parts of England where Labour is roundly expected to get hammered, and Keir Starmer's job is expected to hang in the balance. But one party insider grimly joked, after this week: \"The best-case scenario for the PM is that he gets to May, and then there is a failed challenge.\" What about the worst-case scenario? You'd calmed everybody down, bond yields happy, Labour backbenchers happy, then you throw it all up in the air again!\" Separate to the Budget process, unions and business and ministers had been trying to find a compromise over how long workers would have to be in a job before getting the right to claim they'd been unfairly sacked. It's not complicated and it's made the Labour-trade union relationship more difficult and created unnecessary tension for Starmer and Reeves in the event of things tanking after local elections.\" In other words, leadership watch out. Growth is predicted to be still sludgy for years, slower than expected all the way up until 2030. One city figure told me: \"The left side of Labour might hate business but that's what pays for the things they want - it cannot fund the triple lock, welfare, and the NHS unless the economy grows.\" Another senior business figure told me: \"I think we are bit screwed aren't we - by end of the decade we are going to spend nearly 400 billion on pensions and welfare - growth is clearly not at the top of the list.\" The minimum wage is going up. Pointing to decisions on Heathrow and new nuclear, they hit back: \"If those businesses want to employ decent people in the years to come, it's quite a good idea those children don't go hungry when they are growing up.\" PA Wire Starmer himself will insist the government is just as committed to growth as it's always been in his speech next week, and is likely to emphasise his desire to get rid of red tape and speed up the planning system. Multiple sources suggest Labour switching to a more traditional focus to please its party removes what sometimes felt like a contradiction - a focus on helping business make money at the same time as pursuing its own values. One former minister suggested that since the high-tax, high-spend Budget, the difference between the two parties was now as clear as it was in 1992. As one business leader suggested, the increase to the minimum wage and increased taxes could mean \"everyone will just not hire - there's nothing to create confidence for us when we desperately need it.\" The Treasury might hope something else turns up and the long-term picture improves, perhaps because of advances in AI, perhaps because of planning reforms, perhaps because of, who knows. That's not just because having repeatedly promised not to increase income taxes, the chancellor is doing precisely that by freezing the level where you start paying tax, breaking certainly the spirit if not the precise letter of the party's election manifesto. Getty Images Richard Hughes, chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility (left), flanked by Andy King and Prof David Miles Repeatedly, and unusually publicly, the chancellor talked about how changes to the financial picture would leave her with no choice but to take those pesky, difficult decisions, i.e. Many briefings were deliberate, including suggestions just last week that the numbers from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had come in more or less at the last moment, looking more rosy than had been expected . What we now know is that the OBR, which released this information late on Friday, had weeks before told Rachel Reeves that because more tax had come in, there wasn't actually a hole in her finances after all. But even one Labour insider questions whether the government crossed the line: \"Everyone knows the game, but there's a line between rolling the pitch and simply misleading the public and the lobby.\" In the worst-case scenario, the very messy Budget process has damaged trust in the government even more, and given their opponents more reason to hurl accusations of bad faith and bad behaviour right in heir face.

      "summary_tr_long": "Faisal Islam Economics editor BBC Budget days used to be symbolised by the chancellor of the exchequer smiling and holding aloft the famous Red Box outside Number 11. Now a debate is bubbling about whether this small department, known as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - and staffed mainly by young intellectuals and civil servants - is in fact too powerful, with claims from some that it is essentially half-running the government economic policy. If she wants to change the policies, she can change the policies.\" Getty Images A debate is bubbling about whether the department, known to few outside this closed world, is in fact too powerful Officially the OBR monitors the UK government's spending plans and performance, and releases forecasts for the economy and public finances twice a year, (alongside the Budget and Spring Statement), which assess whether the government is likely to meet the rules it has set over tax and spending. When Labour entered office in 2024 it passed a new law giving it new powers to initiate forecasts, even when the government does not ask it to. This was prompted by the Conservatives' mini-Budget of September 2022, which promised big tax cuts but did not say how they would be paid for, and spooked financial markets. At the time I reported that the then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng had brushed away the offer from the OBR of an official forecast, which could either have given some comfort to the markets that the plan had been fully costed, or impeded the Truss administration's ability to announce those policy changes. WPA Pool/Getty Images The Conservatives' mini-Budget of September 2022, which promised big tax cuts but did not say how they would be paid for, spooked financial markets Empowering the OBR was, in fact, part of Rachel Reeves's plan. When I asked the chancellor about a statement from the OBR, issued two months earlier, that \"promises made are constantly not kept\" on tax and spending, Reeves replied: \"The OBR have got an important job to do and their job is to produce forecasts on the economy - not to give a running commentary on government policy.\" Office for Budget Responsibility Richard Hughes, the former Treasury mandarin, educated at Oxford and Harvard, is at the helm of the OBR Yet the message I received from that exchange with Richard Hughes was clear: the OBR's true power is not at all at the level its critics suggest. \"They are inescapably political.\" At the end of October, one month before the Budget, the OBR is understood to have lowered its forecast for productivity - a measure of the output of the economy per hour worked - by 0.3 percentage points. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, for every 0.1 percentage point downgrade in the productivity forecast, government borrowing would increase by £7bn in 2029-30 - meaning a 0.3 point cut could add £21bn to Rachel Reeves's Budget black hole. For example, if this downgrade had been given when, say, Jeremy Hunt was chancellor, it would have been far more difficult - impossible says the current Treasury - for the Conservatives to deliver the pre-election National Insurance cuts that he did in March 2024. \"A body designed to police cuts is now being asked to referee a strategy for growth, and it simply isn't built for the task.\" But Richard Hughes told me in March he was simply accounting for the numbers, and that it is the chancellor and Parliament that have £3 trillion a year worth of power to make decisions on either raising revenues or spending them. A need for 'reconstruction' In late September 2008, as the world and Britain especially was convulsed by its biggest ever financial crisis, the Conservative Party published an obscure pamphlet titled \"Reconstruction\". British building society Bradford & Bingley had just been nationalised; US investment bank Lehman Brothers had collapsed a fortnight before; and half the British banking system was being prepared for state bailouts, and the pamphlet reflected what researchers were saying was best practice in the field of fiscal policy. Getty Images US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008 The office was first established by the coalition government in 2010, then put on a permanent statutory footing in March 2011. Take the fallout after Robert Chote, then chair of the OBR, published a chart showing spending levels at their lowest since the 1930s. AFP via Getty Images Chancellor George Osborne predicted that appointing independent economists was likely going to cause the coalition government some problems Since then, the former Prime Minister Liz Truss, has made claims that a \"deep state\" played a part in bringing down her brief government - \"the economic establishment, who fundamentally don't want the status quo to change\", as she put it. Richard Hughes (left), Andy King, who was a member of the Budget Responsibility Committee of the Office for Budget Responsibility until August 2023, and David Miles (right) Richard Hughes and Tom Josephs both had senior positions in charge of fiscal policy at the Treasury, while Prof David Miles is a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee and chief economist at Morgan Stanley.

      "summary_tr_long": "The curious case of why Poundland is struggling during a cost-of-living crisis Emma Simpson Business correspondent BBC The residents of Peckham in south London have just lost their Poundland store, which closed this week after 11 years of trading. Rye Lane in south London - a lively, multicultural high street - is losing its pound shop, after 11 years of trading More than 100 of its shops have either shut or been earmarked for closure since the summer. That's after the business was sold in June for a nominal £1 amid \"challenging trading conditions\". It does have a turnaround plan but by the end of the process, Poundland expects to end up with between 650 and 700 shops, compared with the 800-odd it had at the start of this year. Elsewhere on UK high streets, the Original Factory shop is struggling and has shut at least 22 shops. And B&M Bargains, one of the UK's biggest discount chains, has launched a turnaround plan due to weak sales. Bloomberg via Getty Images Poundland was sold in June for a nominal £1 amid 'challenging trading conditions' All big retailers have faced a substantial increase in employer costs because of last year's Budget, but it's more difficult when you're selling the cheapest products because there's less wiggle room to absorb the extra costs, or to pass them on to customers. After inflation, selling a product for £1 in 1990, when Poundland began, is the equivalent of selling it for 40p today. The entrepreneur who cracked the model Chris Edwards, a businessman from Yorkshire, has spent more than 50 years working in retail's bargain basement. He and his son were the team behind Poundworld, which they sold for £150m 10 years ago. In 2019, they started a new chain, OneBelow, selling everything for £1 or less - but three years later they had to change tactics. It's now called OneBeyond, with almost everything at £1 or above. \"What tipped us over the edge was the [post-pandemic] shipping crisis, when we couldn't get containers through and the cost of freight was ridiculous.\" 'We realised the pound game wasn't going to work any more,' says Chris Edwards But Mr Edwards says his business model still works: in his view, it comes down to experience, negotiating skill and getting the mix of products just right. As for making economics stack up, he says sometimes he is able to secure cheap prices on UK stock from big-name brands but when he can't he sacrifices profits in order to attract shoppers. The father and son duo grew Poundworld into a chain of more than 300 shops, before selling it in 2015 to an American investor. \"They tried to sell other things but not in a controlled way like we do it.\" Wilko also lost its way, tipping into administration in 2023 with the loss of thousands of jobs. The business had drifted further and further from its original premise - lots of products for £1 - and was selling them instead at a wide range of different prices. This has meant closing 57 unprofitable stores and negotiating steep rent cuts with landlords, where it can. Another 48 shops are being shut as these landlords have decided to take back the leases and find new occupiers instead. The main budget chains now have 3,400 shops across the UK, according to data analytics firm, Geolytix. The number of them more than doubled between 2009 and 2015 - but numbers have risen only slightly since then. Back in 2009 the UK was in the teeth of a recession, following the global financial crisis. Getty High street shopping has evolved since the 1970s, when shops like Woolworths were hugely popular Discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl also grew rapidly during this period, luring millions of customers away from the established grocers with cheaper prices. By 2019, much of the budget store growth was happening in out-of-town locations and retail parks, a trend accelerated by the pandemic. Sales figures are hard to come by, but Mintel data suggests 30% of online shoppers in the UK shopped with Temu in the year to September 2025, while 14% shopped with AliExpress and 3% with DHGate, another Chinese marketplace, in the same period. AFP via Getty Images Chinese brands like Shein sell products in bulk from their huge factories - inside one of their enormous factories Amazon has also got in on the act by launching its own ultra-low-cost shopping section, Amazon Haul. So this sort of wave of low-cost influence from outside of the UK isn't slowing down, and I think there's much more to come.\" There are also new selling platforms like TikTok Shop, Catherine Shuttleworth points out, where you can find people advertising anything from sweets and toilet paper to pillows. \"It's not just the standard retailer they used to go to - it could be anybody.\" Getty Images On selling platforms like TikTok Shop, you can find people advertising anything from sweets, pillows and toilet paper to beauty products The danger for traditional budget shops is that they will no longer be seen as being the cheapest in the market. The Range has continued to expand, opening 60 standalone stores this year, after acquiring the DIY chain Homebase out of administration. \"For some people, budget shopping is a hobby,\" she adds, \"but for others it's an absolute necessity.\" BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.",

      "summary_tr_long": "The £5.30 orange juice that tells the story of why supermarket prices are sky high Faisal Islam Economics editor BBC Listen to Faisal read this article There has been more than a bitter twang in the glasses at British breakfast tables. Only five years ago, a typical supermarket own-label carton of orange juice could be bought for 76p for 1 litre. That's a rise of 134% since 2020, and it's up 29% just in the past year. In cafes and restaurants it's a similar story - with £3.50 to £4 now a standard price point for a glass of basic OJ. One colleague was outraged to be sent a bill for £9 for a glass of hangover-busting orange juice and lemonade at an unassuming little restaurant in Kent. Asked why so much, she was told that the orange juice - albeit freshly squeezed - accounted for £5.30 of the price. All of this is compounded by grocery price inflation which, after hitting 17.5% in 2023, came down (to around 5.7% in August) but is rising once again. Plus new figures for overall inflation released today put it at 3.8% - marking the 12th month in a row it is above the Bank of England’s 2% target. Hulton Archive/Getty Images Orange juice from concentrate was commercialised by Minute Maid Orange juice is nearly 90% water. WW2 ended before the troops got to try it, but it ended up being commercialised by what became the American soft drink giant, Minute Maid. TV Times/ Getty Images/ Screen Archives Minute Maid orange juice was popularised by Bing Crosby Flash forward to today and an estimated 2.5 billion gallons of orange juice are drunk each year - with about a tenth of that in the UK, where the market is still growing. His firm Gerald McDonald and Co is named after his great-grandfather, a pioneer who was importing orange concentrate as far back as the 1940s from what was then British-mandate Palestine. But prices reached extraordinary heights in global markets, rising from $1(75p) to $1.50 (£1.12) per lb over the last decade, to a record $5.30 per lb by the end of last year. \"For such a major commodity to go from $2 to $7 is insane, but it took a while to filter through to consumers.\" Until 2023 the rise in orange juice prices was disguised among food inflation in general, explains Philip Coverdale, an industry expert at consultancy firm GlobalData. (Plus Spain too suffered from weather-related production slumps, including the floods in Valencia last October.) AFP via Getty Images Spain has suffered from weather-related production slumps Even within Brazil the market is concentrated in the hands of huge industrialised conglomerates. \"It's very difficult to get oranges out of Florida [because of the shortages] and it's too expensive.\" VW Pics/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Spain also grows oranges - but Valencia and Seville oranges are mostly exported as fruit, rather than concentrate One of the leading suppliers to Tropicana sold off some of its land earlier this year to build homes. One of Tropicana's recent product innovations in the US has been to launch an \"essentials\" brand of orange juice \"blends\" - combining orange, apple and pear juice - at a lower price. US exports of orange juice to Canada have slumped to a 20-year low after Canada put counter-tariffs on US exports. The Trump administration has also settled on a 10% tariff on orange juice coming from Brazil, which will feed into US supermarket prices. In 2024, the UK eliminated tariffs on some imports produced from fruit grown outside Britain. Getty Images The Trump administration has put a 10% tariff on orange juice coming from Brazil Then there are new regulations around packaging, further adding to the pressures. Yet it coincides with sinking demand: global consumption of orange juice is now down 30% from a peak two decades ago. AFP via Getty Images South Africa grows oranges but its supplies are small Ultimately, however, orange juice is a staple that supermarkets have long been used to selling at low prices. And the price spikes to £2 a carton could, with for example better weather, simply reverse. \"The volatility in the harvest appears to have reduced,\" says Giles Hurley, UK CEO of Aldi, \"Our buying team are doing everything they can to ensure that that saving is passed on to consumers.\" Others in the supply chain are less convinced, given that much of the frozen concentrate was bought at last year's high prices. Butter is up almost 19%, and chocolate and coffee 15% and milk over 12%, all according to the Office for National Statistics. It's difficult to uncover relationships between retailers and manufacturers or farmers and the use of contracts.\" There is also a broader question that goes well beyond orange juice: do consumers in the UK need to simply accept the fact that as a densely populated small country with limited agriculture, a changing climate means the UK will be increasingly exposed to food price shocks? A 2024 government report on food security noted: \"The UK continues to be highly dependent on imports to meet consumer demand for fruit, vegetables and seafood... \"Many of the countries the UK imports these foods from are subject to their own climate-related challenges and sustainability risks.\" And so it could be that this is only the start of a wild ride on what we pay for our food and drink.

      "summary_tr_long": "How Milei's 'Thatcherite' economics divided his nation - but won over Trump Ione Wells South America Correspondent BBC Buenos Aires, September 2023. In 2019, he dressed up in a \"libertarian superhero\" costume, purporting to be from Liberland - a land where no taxes are paid. In 2018, he smashed a piñata of the Central Bank on live television. According to official data, inflation in 2023 topped 211% annually - Milei took office in December of that year. Roughly 40% of the population lived in poverty. Yet nearly two years on, the headline figures are vastly different: Argentina recorded its first fiscal surplus in 14 years and inflation, which had hit triple figures annually, has tumbled to roughly 36%. The UK Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch called the measures Milei has taken a \"template\" for a future Conservative government. And in the US, President Donald Trump described Milei as \"my favourite president\". Although that recently slipped, Washington's decision last week to swap $20bn (£15bn) in dollars for pesos, effectively propping up Argentina's currency with International Monetary Fund (IMF) backing, is a sign Milei's fiscal shock therapy has appeased international lenders. \"The adjustment in the end was directed at the working classes, not the caste.\" Reuters Milei's reforms have prompted heated protests Milei's critics argue that the price of his changes have been recession, job losses, weaker public services and declining household budgets. With midterm elections looming on 26 October, Argentina is about to deliver its verdict: will Milei be punished for doing what he set out to do — and could losing political support completely unravel his economic gains? Argentines feeling the cost Around 700 miles from the capital in the Misiones province, tea farmer Ygor Sobol looks anxious. Now I am completely without employees.\" For three generations his family has grown yerba mate, a drink popular with Argentines, but since Milei deregulated his industry by scrapping minimum prices, he says that his crops have become worth less than the cost of producing them. \"I have environmental controls, labour controls - we don't pay people $80 (£60) a month, or have 16-hour work days that might be allowed in places like Bangladesh or Vietnam. \"Our sector lost more than 10,000 direct jobs. If you add indirect jobs, there are many more.\" Mr Galfione also blames rising costs of utilities, health and schools for reducing the disposable income of average people, and in turn making them less likely to buy clothes. Public spending was high, even before the Covid-19 pandemic. Argentina, still, owes £31bn in debt to the IMF. Or didn't recognise that inflation was a product of so much public spending.\" EPA - EFE/REX/Shutterstock Opponents of Javier Milei say ordinary people have been left with less disposable income Inflation ate away the peso currency's purchasing power. He went viral for ripping government ministries such as Culture and Women off a whiteboard while shouting 'afuera!' - 'out!' Among other austerity measures, he halved government ministries, cut tens of thousands of public jobs, slashed budgets including for education, health, pensions and infrastructure, and removed subsidies – spiking utility and transport prices. His initial devaluing of the peso by 50% caused inflation to spike but then it fell as people spent less and demand fell. EPA/Shutterstock Milei's supporters credit him with taming Argentina's previously rampant inflation 'Echoes of Thatcherism' When I met him in April 2024 at his office, there were sculptures of him with a chainsaw on display and coasters showing Margaret Thatcher's face. Thatcher is loathed by many people in Argentina owing to the Falklands War, but Milei told me he admired her and that she was \"brilliant.\" Last month one British newspaper described Milei's own approach as having \"echoes of Thatcherism\". Reuters Javier Milei's reforms have drawn comparisons with those of Margaret Thatcher He believes this will help alleviate poverty in the long-run and enable lower taxes, but also help people to plan their own spending more easily with inflation currently fluctuating less. On 7 September Milei's party lost unexpectedly badly in the Buenos Aires provincial elections. EPA - EFE/REX/Shutterstock Some observers say Milei displays a lack of empathy towards those affected by cuts Financial markets had generally supported his economic programme. But the midterm elections were upcoming and the £15bn of debt repayments are due next year. Trump's £15bn currency swap lifeline has provided some stability: Argentine bonds and the peso rose in value in response to the announcement. But D'Alessandro argues that though US intervention might solve a wider problem, nothing will change in \"people's real lives\". Some of Milei's supporters - like Mr Boggiano - believe there is something else at play in the round criticism of the president: In this view much of it comes down to the opposition trying to \"break\" what Milei has done, in order to get back into power. Meanwhile, Argentina owes $20bn of debt next year. The left-wing governor of Buenos Aires, Axel Kicillof, has been touted as a future presidential candidate, long ahead of the elections in 2027. Still, he believes it is too early to judge: \"We are in the middle of his term… The story hasn't finished.\" Top picture credit: WPA Pool/Getty Images, Bloomberg via Getty Images BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Hatta Batı bölgelerde yılbaşında kar gözükmüyor. Ama bu soğuk hava önümüzdeki 10-15 gün devam edecek gibi gözüküyor. 10-15 gün bu soğukların devam etmesi demek Anadolu'da kar yüksekliğinin daha da artması demek.

'Sarı Denizaltılar', Asensio'yu yaz transfer döneminde de kadrosuna katmak istemiş ama yapılan teklif İspanyol orta sahanın sportif ve finansal beklentilerini karşılamadığı için Fenerbahçe'ye imza atmıştı. \"VILLARREAL'İN ARADIĞI LİDER\" Haberde Marco Asensio'nun tecrübesi, kalitesi ve büyük maçlarda fark yaratma yeteneği nedeniyle Villarreal'in saha içinde aradığı lider oyuncu profiline mükemmel bir şekilde uyduğu aktarılırken, La Liga'ya dönüş fikrinin Asensio'yu cezbettiği iddia edildi.

Uzun yıllardır hormon replasman tedavisi bu semptomların en etkili çözümü olarak görülse de birçok kadın için hormon kullanımı ciddi sağlık riskleri taşıyor. 2025’te bu alanda tarihi bir eşik aşıldı. ABD Gıda ve İlaç Dairesi (FDA), Lynkuet (elinzanetant) adlı yeni bir ilacı onayladı. Bu ilaç, 2023’te onay alan Veozah (fezolinetant) ile birlikte menopoz tedavisinde hormonal olmayan yeni bir dönemin kapısını araladı. Bu ilaçlar, beynin hipotalamus bölgesinde yer alan ve vücut sıcaklığını düzenleyen özel sinir hücrelerini hedef alıyor. Bilim insanları, bu nöronların menopoz sırasında östrojen dalgalanmalarına karşı aşırı hassas hale geldiğini keşfetmişti. Günlük hap şeklinde kullanılan bu tedaviler, hormon içermeden orta ve şiddetli sıcak basmalarını belirgin biçimde azaltabiliyor. Uzmanlara göre bu gelişme, özellikle kanser öyküsü olan kadınlar için “önemli bir dönüm noktası.” 2- ÇOCUKLAR İÇİN İĞNESİZ ALERJİ İLACI: HAYAT KURTARAN BURUN SPREYİ Gıda alerjileri, günümüzde her 13 çocuktan birini etkiliyor ve şiddetli alerjik reaksiyonlar (anafilaksi) ölümcül olabiliyor. Ancak epinefrin oto-enjektörleri (EpiPen gibi) çocuklarda ve bakım verenlerde iğne korkusu nedeniyle her zaman zamanında kullanılamıyor. 2025’te bu soruna köklü bir çözüm geldi. Neffy adlı reçeteli burun spreyi, çocuklar için epinefrin uygulamasında 30 yılı aşkın süredir yapılan ilk büyük yenilik olarak onaylandı. İğne içermeyen bu yöntem, dört yaş ve üzeri, 15-30 kilogram arasındaki çocuklar için kullanılabiliyor. Neffy, burun mukozasındaki hücreler arasındaki boşluğu geçici olarak genişleten özel bir teknoloji sayesinde ilacın hızla kana karışmasını sağlıyor. Uzmanlar, bu spreyin özellikle okul çağındaki çocuklar için müdahaleyi kolaylaştıracağını ve alerjik acil durumlarda hayat kurtarma oranını artıracağını belirtiyor. 3- REJENERATİF TIPTA BİLİM KURGUYU GERÇEĞE YAKLAŞTIRAN GELİŞMELER Kaybedilen organların veya uzuvların yeniden büyütülmesi uzun yıllar bilim kurgunun konusu oldu. Ancak 2025’te bu hayal gerçeğe bir adım daha yaklaştı. Bilim insanları, uzuvlarını kaybettikten sonra yeniden büyütebilen semenderleri inceleyerek rejenerasyonun moleküler temelini ortaya çıkardı. Araştırmalar, uzuv yenilenmesi için kritik olan retinoid asit seviyelerini kontrol eden bir enzimi ve uzvun boyutunu belirleyen anahtar bir geni tanımladı. Bilim insanları, maymunlar üzerinde kalp duvarını güçlendiren ilk implante edilebilir kalp yamasını başarıyla denedi. Laboratuvarda kök hücrelerden üretilen bu doku, kalbe entegre edilerek kalp yetmezliği için yeni bir tedavi seçeneği sundu. Ayrıca ilk kez kök hücrelerden işlevsel üreter dokusu üretildi; bu, böbrek sisteminin yenilenmesi yolunda kritik bir adım olarak değerlendiriliyor. 4- CİNSEL YOLLA BULAŞAN ENFEKSİYONLARDA EVDEN TANI DÖNEMİ ABD’de her yıl iki milyondan fazla kişiye cinsel yolla bulaşan enfeksiyon (CYBE) teşhisi konuluyor. 2025’te CYBE taramalarında önemli yenilikler hayata geçti. Teal Wand adlı yeni sistem, kadınların evde vajinal örnek alarak HPV taraması yapmasına olanak tanıyor. Kısa bir çevrim içi görüşmenin ardından reçete edilen bu cihaz, özellikle rahim ağzı kanseri taramalarında katılım oranını artırmayı hedefliyor. Buna ek olarak, reçetesiz satılan Visby testi, gonore, klamidya ve trikomoniyazisi evde ve 30 dakika içinde tespit edebiliyor. Uzmanlara göre bu tür testler, erken tanı sayesinde hem bireysel sağlığı hem de toplum sağlığını korumada önemli rol oynayacak. 5- TEK BİR ÇOCUK İÇİN TASARLANAN KİŞİSELLEŞTİRİLMİŞ gen tedavisi CRISPR-Cas9 gen düzenleme teknolojisi, son yıllarda genetik hastalıkların tedavisinde devrim yarattı. Ancak 2025’te bu teknoloji ilk kez tek bir hasta için özel olarak tasarlanmış bir tedavide kullanıldı. Philadelphia Çocuk Hastanesi’nde doktorlar, nadir ve ölümcül bir metabolik hastalıkla doğan bir bebek için kişiselleştirilmiş gen tedavisi geliştirdi. CRISPR aracı, lipid nanopartiküller aracılığıyla karaciğere ulaştırıldı ve hatalı gen düzeltildi. Bu vaka, gelecekte nadir hastalıkların “tek tek” tedavi edilebileceği bir dönemin habercisi olarak görülüyor. 6- HIV ÖNLEMEDE YILDA İKİ KEZ ENJEKSİYON DÖNEMİ HIV, küresel ölçekte hâlâ büyük bir halk sağlığı sorunu olmaya devam ediyor. 2025’te FDA, Yeztugo (lenacapavir) adlı yılda yalnızca iki kez uygulanan PrEP enjeksiyonunu onayladı. Klinik çalışmalar, bu ilacın HIV bulaşmasını neredeyse tamamen önlediğini ortaya koydu. Dünya Sağlık Örgütü, bu gelişmeyi HIV ile mücadelede “tarihi bir dönüm noktası” olarak tanımladı. 7- AŞILARIN ENFEKSİYONUN ÖTESİNDEKİ KORUYUCU GÜCÜ 2025’te yapılan araştırmalar, aşıların yalnızca enfeksiyonları değil, kalp krizi, felç ve bunama riskini de azaltabileceğini gösterdi. Zona aşısı yaptıran kişilerde inme riskinin yüzde 16, kalp krizi riskinin ise yüzde 18 azaldığı tespit edildi. Ayrıca Covid-19 mRNA aşısı olan bazı kanser hastalarının, tedaviye daha iyi yanıt verdiği ve daha uzun yaşadığı gözlemlendi. Bilim insanları, bağışıklık sisteminin genel olarak güçlendirilmesinin bu etkilerde rol oynayabileceğini düşünüyor. 8- PANKREAS KANSERİNİ ORTAYA ÇIKMADAN DURDURMA UMUDU Pankreas kanseri, genellikle geç evrede teşhis edilmesi nedeniyle en ölümcül kanser türlerinden biri. 2025’te yapılan çalışmalar, hastalığın erken evrede hatta başlamadan durdurulabileceğine dair umut verdi. Araştırmacılar, FGFR2 adlı proteinin bloke edilmesinin, erken evre pankreas hücrelerinin kansere dönüşmesini engelleyebildiğini ortaya koydu. Bu proteini hedef alan ilaçların hâlihazırda mevcut olması, yüksek risk grubundaki kişiler için önleyici tedavilerin önünü açabilir. 9- İNSAN VÜCUDUNUN EN KAPSAMLI ATLASI OLUŞTURULDU İngiltere merkezli UK Biobank projesi, 100 bin gönüllüden alınan bir milyardan fazla taramayla insan vücudunun bugüne kadarki en ayrıntılı atlasını oluşturdu. Beyin, kalp, kemikler, damarlar ve iç organlara ait detaylı veriler, hastalıkların erken teşhisinde devrim yaratabilecek nitelikte. Bu veriler sayesinde bilim insanları, kalp hastalığı belirtileri ile beyin sağlığı arasındaki güçlü bağlantıyı ortaya koydu. National Geographic'in “9 medical breakthroughs that gave us hope in 2025” başlıklı haberinden derlenmiştir.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Bebek monitörü kızı Miley'nin gözünde bir ‘parlama’ olduğunu ortaya çıkardı. Bu parlamanın ise daha sonra retinoblastom (nadir görülen bir göz kanseri) olduğu anlaşıldı. 28 yaşındaki anne Kristen, \"Bebek monitöründen kızının gözündeki tümörü bulan bir anne hakkında bir makale okumuştum. Miley'yi yatağına koyduktan sonra odadan çıktım. Sonra monitörden baktığımda, onun da gözünde aynı parlamanın olduğunu gördüm. Ancak bu, bir şeylerin ters gittiğine dair tek işaret değildi; monitördeki görüntü sadece annenin Miley'nin hasta olduğuna dair şüphelerini doğrulamıştı. İLK İŞARET GÖZ KAYMASIYDI Eylül ayında Miley'nin ikinci doğum gününden kısa bir süre sonra, ailesi sol gözünde bir kayma fark etti. Anne Kristen, \"Kocama bunu gösterdim çünkü içimde kötü bir his vardı. Kanser aklıma gelmemişti, retinoblastomun varlığından bile haberim yoktu” diye konuştu. Bir çocuk doktoruna Miley'nin gözünün fotoğrafını gönderdiler. Doktor onları bir göz hastalıkları uzmanına sevk etti ancak randevu için aralık ayına kadar beklemeleri gerekiyordu. Doktorlar başlangıçta Miley'nin sadece gözlüğe ihtiyacı olduğunu düşünmüştü. Retinoblastoma nadir olmakla birlikte çocukluk çağında en sık görülen göz kanseridir. ABD’de her yıl yaklaşık 300 vakaya teşhis koyulmaktadır. Çoğunlukla 2-3 yaş arası bebeklerde görülür ve beş yıllık hayatta kalma oranı yüzde 96'dır. Gözün gelişimiyle bağlantılı bir gendeki genetik mutasyonla tetiklendiği için en sık çocuklarda görülen bir kanser türüdür. FLAŞLI FOTOĞRAF ELE VERDİ Kasım ayında bir gece Miley'ye banyo yaptırırken durum endişe verici bir hal aldı. Kristen, \"O gece gözünü gördüm ve 'bu normal değil' diye düşündüm. Flaşlı bir fotoğrafını çektik ve göz bebeğinde kırmızılık yerine beyazlık gördük. İnternette belirtileri araştırırken, genellikle üç yaş altı çocukları etkileyen nadir bir kanser türü olan retinoblastom ile karşılaştı. Aynı gece bebek monitörünü kontrol ettiğinde o meşhur beyaz parlamayı tekrar gördü. Ertesi sabah Miley'nin sağlam gözünü eliyle kapatınca, diğer gözünün tamamen sola kaydığını ve o gözün hiç görmediğini fark ettiler. Yapılan ultrason ve MR incelemeleri, tümörün Miley'nin tüm göz küresini kapladığını ortaya çıkardı. Doktorlar bunun ‘Evre E’ (en kötü evre) olduğunu söylediler. 22 Kasım'da Miley'nin sol gözü ameliyatla alındı. Şimdi kemoterapiye ihtiyaç duyup duymadığını belirlemek için biyopsi sonuçları bekleniyor. Miley'ye ileride protez göz takılması planlanıyor. Kristen ve eşi Andrew, bir yandan 8 haftalık bebekleri Lilly ve 13 yaşındaki kızları Aniston ile ilgilenirken, diğer yandan bu zorlu süreçle mücadele ediyorlar. Bazen bebeklerimizin fotoğrafını çektiğimizde her iki göz bebeği arasında bir renk farkı gözlemleyebiliriz. Bu durum bazen o andaki duruşa, bakış pozisyonuna bağlı olabilir bazen de bazı hastalıkları bize gösterebilir. Nadiren göz içinde arkaya doğru ilerleyen beyne atlayan ve öldürücü olabilen bir tümörün varlığını bile gösterebilir. Bu durum, daha sıklıkla da doğumsal katarakt, o tarafta göz bebeğinde beyaz refleye neden olur. Üyesi Elvan Yalçın FARK EDİLMESİ ÇOK ZOR Kristen şimdi hikayesini, diğer ebeveynlerin belirtileri bilmesi umuduyla paylaşıyor. \"Kameramın flaşı ve bebek telsizi kızımın hayatını kurtardı diyebilirim. Bir aydır görmüyormuş ve biz fark etmemişiz bile. Eğer çocuğunuzun gözünde ışık görürseniz ve kırmızı yerine beyaz bir yansıma fark ederseniz, göz bebeğinin arkasında bir tümör olabilir” diyen Kristen ekledi: “Doktorlar, bu hastalığın fark edilmesinin çok zor olduğunu, çünkü Miley'nin görme kaybına rağmen tamamen normal davrandığını belirtti. En ufak bir göz kaymasında bile mutlaka bir uzmana gidilmeli.” Bazı retina hastalıkları, örneğin erken doğuma bağlı prematüre retinopati veya retinadaki birtakım problemler de fotoğraflarda göz bebeğinde beyaz refle nedeni olabilir. Tabii ki ölümcül olabilecek bir tümörün önemi çok fazladır ama diğer durumlarda da görme bozukluğu ve kalıcı görme kaybına neden olabileceği için gözlerinde farklı bir beyazlık veya farklı bir kırmızılık görülen bebekler mutlaka göz muayenesine götürülmelidir. Üyesi Elvan Yalçın TEŞHİS KONDUĞUNDA HENÜZ ALTI AYLIKTI Miley’in yaşadığı durumun aynısı henüz altı aylıkken Benny’nin de başına geldi. O gece annesi beşiğindeki Benny'i bebek monitöründen izliyordu. Oğlunun gözlerinden birinin tamamen siyah, diğerinin ise ekranda parlayan bir ışık gibi göründüğünü fark eden anne önce bunun monitörden kaynaklı bir durum olduğunu düşündü. Ancak büyükannesi de Benny'nin gözünün belirli ışıkta bulanık göründüğünü söyleyince anne çocuk doktoruna gitmeye karar verdi. Çekilen MR sonrası Benny'e çocuklarda genellikle gözün arkasında başlayan ve çok nadir görülen bir retina kanseri olan retinoblastoma teşhisi koyuldu. Çocuk hastanesindeki doktorlar kanseri tedavi etmeyi ve Benny'nin sol gözündeki görme yetisinin bir kısmını kurtarmayı başardı ancak isminin açıklanmasını istemeyen anne, oğlunun halen görme sorunları yaşadığını söyledi. Doktorlar, Benny'nin tüm vücuduna kemoterapi vermek yerine, iplik kadar ince bir tüp olan mikro kateteri bacağındaki bir atardamara yerleştirip vücudundan geçirerek gözdeki tümöre doğru yönlendirdi. Yani kitlenin içine doğrudan kemoterapi uygulandı. Doktorların kanserinin kökenini araştırmak için yaptığı kapsamlı genetik tarama sonunda Benny'de nadir görülen bir durum olan ve başka tıbbi sorunlara yol açabilen kromozom 13'ün bir kısmında eksiklik olduğu ortaya çıktı. Şimdi 18 aylık olan Benny'nin kanserden kurtulduğu açıklandı ancak kontroller için her ay hastaneye gitmesi gerekiyor. Doktorlar çocuğun sol gözündeki görme yetisinin büyük bir çoğunluğunu kurtarabildi ama bir miktar görme kaybı hâlâ var. Bu değişime uyum sağlamasına yardımcı olması için Benny görme ve işitme engellilerin gittiği bir okula devam ediyor. Retinoblastoma, ender rastlanan bir çocukluk çağı tümörüdür. Tedavi edilmediği takdirde ölümcül olabilir ve bazı hastalarda kalıtımsal olarak görülebilir. Kalıtımsal olduğu durumlarda her iki gözde görülme olasılığı daha yüksektir ama kalıtımsal değilse genel olarak tek taraflıdır. Kalıtımsal olsa da olmasa da hastaların hepsinde 13'üncü kromozomda genlerde bir bozukluk mevcuttur. Hastalık hiçbir bulguya neden olmadan seyredebileceği gibi bazen gözde kaymaya, şaşılığa, titremeye neden olabilir, o taraftaki göz bebeğinde beyaz ışık reflesi yaratabilir. Bu nedenle erken dönem bebeklikte mutlaka göz muayenesi ve kontroller çok önemlidir.

TÜM KAYITLAR ALINDI Savcılık, uçağın uçuşa elverişli olup olmadığını tespit etmek amacıyla teknik bilirkişilerden rapor istedi. Uçağın son bakımlarını gerçekleştiren personelin sorumluluğu ve olası kusurları da mercek altına alındı. Havaalanındaki kamera kayıtlarına el koyulurken, kule ile uçak arasındaki tüm telsiz diyalogları dosya kapsamına dahil edildi. Ayrıca bakım faaliyetleri sırasında uçağa takılan yedek parçaların standartlara uygun olup olmadığının tespiti için teknik incelemelerin dosyaya ekleneceği öğrenildi. Kazada yakıt kirliliği veya yanlış yakıt kullanımı ihtimaline karşı hem yakıt tankerinden hem de uçak enkazından numuneler alındı. Soruşturma sonunda kazanın yapısal bir arıza veya tasarım hatasından kaynaklandığının tespiti halinde sorumluluk zincirinin genişletileceği öğrenildi. Kazanın en kritik delili sayılan kara kutu başta olmak üzere tüm enkaz parçaları muhafaza altına alındı.",
