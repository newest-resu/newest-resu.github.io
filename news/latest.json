      "title": "Tesla Model Y",
      "summary": "Europe's biggest-selling electric car gets some key refinements and improvements, and an entry-level model that champions value for money\n\nThe primacy of the Tesla Model Y - still the best-selling electric car in both the UK and Europe - is slowly fading. Back in 2023, after production at Tesla’s European ‘gigafactory’ in Berlin fully ramped up, this was Europe’s fastest-selling new car of any kind. In 2024, however, it dropped out of the continent’s ‘big three’ - and now seems less and less likely to return.Not that Tesla’s taking this lying down. Late last year, the firm announced this new entry-rung, ‘Standard’ version of the Model Y. At list price, it costs £3000 less than the equivalent bottom-rung model (the RWD) did in 2022, and about £7000 less than the next model up in the lineup.But the car’s headline price is only half of the story. By optimising both equipment specification and performance, Tesla has produced lower cost of insurance and stronger residuals for it; the latter driving value through all-important personal finance. Tesla's manufacturer-backed PCP deals on the Model Y Standard car start at just £300-a-month - the kind of outlay EV owners will be more accustomed to paying for considerably smaller, shorter-range cars from classes below. They could actually be cheaper still once you factor in the £3750 deposit booster offer that the firm is currently offering, to buyers trading in either combustion-engined cars or competitor EVs.As regards the wider Model Y model lineup, a fairly wide-ranging update was executed in 2025. Beyond striking changes to the body, they included a Cybertruck-style front lightbar, and myriad other tweaks to constituted the so-called Juniper facelift.At the same time, pricing was made more competitive than ever. When the Model Y first landed in the UK in 2022, a 434bhp Long Range variant with four-wheel drive would set you back £54,990. Today the same model is marginally less powerful but costs an inflation-busting £51,990, despite having additional kit that includes ventilated front seats and electrically folding rear seatbacks.It’s a strong twin-prong attack. One with a whiff of Hail Mary? Perhaps. So far we've tested both the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive, to which our various figures and charts relate; the Long Range dual-motor car; and the bottom-rung Model Y Standard. The Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive is the mid-ranking Model Y with a declared range of 387 miles and an asking price of £48,990. The list of cars you might conceivably cross-shop with the Tesla is now vastly greater than it was even three years ago, and many of them sit on fresh platforms and certainly aren’t shy when it comes to battery capacity and performance. Tesla has long been a technology leader, but there’s no denying the rest of the world has caught up.Does the hitherto formidable Model Y still cut it? And can some boosted value credentials give it a new lease of life? Let's find out.",

      "title": "First look at crucial DS No7 SUV",
      "summary": "New video reveals No7 to be boxier counterpart to No8; due later this year\n\nDS has published the first images of its forthcoming No7 family SUV and they indicate that it will effectively serve as a more conventional counterpart to the rakish No8 flagship.\nA video posted by DS design director Thierry Métroz shows a digital rendering of the No7 in camouflage, revealing it to share several key design cues with the No8, such as headlights with three main projector beams. \nThe rear end of the No7 is not shown in the video, but it is also likely to mirror the No8, barring the extended rear window and higher roofline.\nIt will be underpinned by the same DS-specific variant of the STLA Medium platform used by the No8, which offers single- and dual-motor electric powertrains with as much as 345bhp and electric ranges of up to 466 miles. The No7’s range is likely to be compromised slightly by its boxier shape, but it should still comfortably tip the 400-mile mark.\nInside, it is expected to be all but identical to the No8 up front, with the same quirky aluminium dashboard panel and wide range of material choices. In the rear, the higher roofline should bring improved second-row comfort, as well as more boot space than the No8’s 560 litres. It is possible that the No7 could also offer a small third row, given this is an option in the closely related Peugeot 5008.\nThe No7 is due in the UK later this year, following the launch of the No8. In replacing the DS 7, the brand’s best-selling model in recent years, it will be crucial in determining the future success of the brand.\nGiven its lower positioning in the DS line-up, the No7 is expected to be slightly cheaper than the No8 – despite being roomier inside. It is possible that it could start at just under £50,000, so that entry-level versions sidestep the Expensive Car Supplement (often referred to as the luxury car tax).",

      "summary": "Big-selling small SUV has a new look. Does it have a new purpose too?\n\nIt’s a sign of the times how important SUVs have become to the business of German premium car maker Audi. Among all of its model lines, its Q-badged cars now have the most global success. And, now entering its third model generation, the little Audi Q3 has become one of its most strategically important.Only the Audi Q5 and Audi A6 commercially outperformed this car in 2024. In 2026, as this third-generation version spreads its wings and registers its first full calendar year of sales, it could well turn out to be the most popular Audi of them all. The production lines at Ingolstadt are, in fact, all teed up to provide extra capacity over and above the circa-250,000 annual volume that the car's long-standing base at Gyor, Hungary, can churn out.The Q3 comes to us bigger than ever, and is the first car in its line to pass 4.5m in length. It retains a range of engines broad enough to include four-cylinder petrol and diesel units, as well as a plug-in hybrid, and offers both default front-wheel drive and Audi-heartland Quattro all-wheel drive. Electric model aside, that's the full house. It's the product of a recently redefined Audi design language, too, and brings new and improved suspension and powertrain technology, and a reappraised secondary control layout replete with newfangled indicator stalks. The stops have been pulled out here: Audi is betting large on small. So what it is so confident about?",

      "title": "Government gives councils new power to ban pavement parking",
      "summary": "Local authorities to be given powers to introduce wider bans on pavement parking\n\nThe government is cracking down on pavement parking by giving local authorities the power to introduce blanket bans on the practice over wider areas.\nAuthorities were previously required to seek restrictions on pavement parking on a street-by-street basis, slowing the rate at which they could take action across neighbourhoods.\nThis year, legislation will be introduced to allow local authorities to enforce against unnecessary obstruction of the pavement. The nature of that enforcement has still to be disclosed, but it is likely to be a fine.\nIn the long term, power over pavement parking will be granted to either the local strategic authority (bodies made up of multiple neighbouring councils), unitary authority or county council, depending on the area. \nThe Department for Transport (DfT) said the decision to grant local authorities more power over whether to allow pavement parking was down to them being “best placed to respond to local needs”.\nPavement parking will still be permissible in areas where it is deemed necessary and does not pose a limitation to more vulnerable pedestrians such as wheelchair users or parents with pushchairs, said the DfT.\nBut it remains to be seen what checks and balances will be implemented to ensure restrictions are not introduced by councils where they are not needed.\nThe move has been welcomed by disability charities and motoring organisations. Andrew Lennox, chief executive of The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, said: “Cars blocking pavements are a nuisance for everyone, but especially dangerous for people with sight loss, who can be forced into the road with traffic they can’t see.\n“Pavement parking is also a barrier that shuts people out of everyday life. When pavements are blocked, people with sight loss lose confidence, independence and the freedom to travel safely. This stops people accessing work, education and social opportunities.”\nRod Dennis, senior policy officer for the RAC, said: “A clear majority of drivers agree that no pavement user should be made to walk or wheel into the road.”",

      "title": "Debate settled: We name every car maker's best model of all time",
      "summary": "Octavia or Superb? 500 or Panda? Series 1 or Range Rover? We hash it out\n\nHere at Autocar, arguments rage pretty much daily. One of the biggest ones we have is over the best car from each manufacturer's back catalogue. \nSome of our staffers see the merits of the MG ZT-T 260...while some don't. Some pick the obvious, some are more obtuse.\nIn order to settle the debate we made shortlists and conducted a vote. And these are the results. Simply the best car from each manufacturer, as picked by our staffers.\nAlfa Romeo\nGiulia Quadrifoglio\n\nThe office bickering began with the first manufacturer on the list, but it was inevitable: how could anyone possibly agree on a 'best' Alfa? 33 Stradale, 75, SZ, GTA, 156, 147, 8C... There was no chance of us even agreeing a top five, surely. But while the debate rumbled on, Alfa coincidentally announced it was keeping the Giulia Quadrifoglio on sale for another year, and we were all so happy about it that we realised it was the obvious answer.\nKris Culmer was among the loudest supporters: \"They designed the most handsome car of the 2010s, spent a mad amount on its chassis and gave it a stonking V6 of Ferrari parentage. When not broken, the Quadrifoglio is amazing.\" A reassuringly traditional and endlessly appealing Alfa that still stuns even in its old age - and one we now have extra time to enjoy.\nAston Martin\nV8 Vantage\n\nA good old fashioned underdog victory here, as the 'baby' Aston snarls ahead of full-blooded bedroom poster cars like the DB9, DB5 and Valkyrie to emerge as Gaydon's greatest. Charlie Martin said Britain's answer to the Porsche 911 \"is what brought Aston back to the fold as a maker of proper 21st-century sports cars\", adding: \"It's powered by what is probably the angriest-sounding V8 ever built.\"\nMatt Prior seemed a bit surprised at his own choice - \"I'd rather have a DB9\" - but conceded he had fond memories of racing one in the 24 Hours of Silverstone. \"Great car. Best weekend ever.\"\nAudi\nQuattro\n\nMichèle Mouton once acknowledged that Audi's original four-wheel-drive sports coupé had a powerful aura: \"If I have some emotion, of course it's the noise of the Quattro. Nobody can forget the noise.\" That from the woman who famously \"didn't feel at all\" when preparing to tackle a WRC stage. How's that for proof of this Group B legend's unfaltering legacy?\nResident rally fanatic James Attwood certainly 'didn't feel' there was much more to say about the warbling wonder: \"Just type 'Audi Quattro Group B' into YouTube and you'll see.\" Jack Harrison said the Quattro is one of those rare cars that \"is not only a style icon but also a mechanical milestone\". Seriously quick, too, even by modern standards.\nBMW\n3 Series\n\nHas there ever been a bad one? There are variants that don't suit specific needs, sure (you wouldn't catch an Uber driver in an M3 Touring CS and a humble 316i wouldn't be much cop at Cadwell Park), but through each of its seven generations, Munich's mid-size executive car has majored on mass appeal with a broad selection of brilliant incarnations that have won it legendary status in every corner of the car world.\nAt least that's what Mark Tisshaw thinks: \"It feels such a reference for the wider market, even today. Such bandwidth in the range, too.\" Jack Warrick called the 3 Series simply \"one of the best all-rounders on sale\", with a consistent excellence that is \"always unmatched\". No pressure on the imminent Mk8, then.\nCitroën\nDS\n\nThe most recent DS we drove was an attractive but unadventurous high-riding hatchback that you would be hard pressed to mark out as a pioneer in any respect. The first DS we ever drove, by way of contrast, was a futuristic tech-fest of a machine like no car that had gone before. It changed the face of luxury motoring forever and these days enjoys true legend status.\nThis hydropneumatically suspended oddball is that rare thing, according to Richard Lane: \"It's an icon of both style and technology. All the derivatives have deep appeal, too, right from the lowliest home-market runabout to a luxe-spec 23 Pallas with reams of leather.\"\nFerrari\n458 Italia\n\nIt's surprising to not have the F40, Enzo, 250 GTO or LaFerrari here, but of all the cars in this feature, the 458's victory-by-vote was among the most resounding. Why? \"It's the best mid-engined 'junior' Ferrari there has ever been,\" according to Matt Saunders. \"It's young enough to have good ergonomics and cabin quality, a modern active diff and sensational handling but old enough to serve them as side dishes to a wonderful, high-revving atmo V8. Deified for good reasons.\"\nNo wonder, really, that values for 458s hold so strong even now (£175k for a late minter): its shrieking V8-\"gloriously unmuffled by turbochargers\", noted Charlie Martin-and uncorrupted dynamics lend it an authenticity and viscerality that have yet to be surpassed.\nFiat\n500\n\nThe VW Beetle has had it licked for longevity, the Mini offered a more spirited drive and the Citroën 2CV was more technically impressive, but no 'people's car' has quite so successfully transcended the boundaries of mere mass mobility as the Fiat 500 to become a fashion icon in its own right. Bought and beloved even by those who could have had something 20 times the price, this tiny Turinese is one of those rare crowd-pleasers whose admirers unquestionably outweigh its detractors.\n\"The fact that millennials and zoomers still crave owning an original 500, nearly 60 years after it was launched, tells you everything,\" said Richard Lane. Illya Verpraet added: \"It also put Italy on the road, practically built a company for decades and formed the basis for the design of Fiat's whole 2010s model line-up.\" How's that for a dolce vita well lived?\nFord\nFocus\n\nThe Focus kept the lights on at Ford of Europe for three decades and delighted millions with an unusual blend of engagement, frugality and utility.\n\"It proves that driver appeal can be placed at the centre of a product and it can still be a smash-hit volume seller and mass-market success,\" said Mark Tisshaw. Rachel Burgess summarised: \"It's a practical, unassuming family car, and one that was thoroughly chuckable around a corner-win-win.\"\nHonda\nNSX\n\n\"The NSX is what happens when a mass-market car firm decides to make a high-tech supercar. Come on: you don't see Ferrari trying to make a Jazz rival, do you?\" James Attwood there, qualifying his nomination for a 1990s performance hero that doesn't quite carry the same cachet these days as its European counterparts but which was no less technically impressive.\nFar from it. In fact, Matt Saunders hailed the NSX for bringing \"prosaic Honda ownership qualities to the super-sports car market and changing it forever\". \"But,\" he added, \"it's just as wonderful for its brilliant hydraulic steering, enticing tactile shift quality and sweet-revving naturally aspirated V6. Honda should dare to dream more often.\"\nJaguar\nXJ\n\nThe E-Type is the most beautiful, the D-Type is a racing legend, the XJ220 was era-defining and the I-Pace was briefly one of the most advanced and striking EVs. But there could only be one victor, as Matt Prior said: \"Jaguar has made many cars that have done many things, but few car makers can be defined by one model. The XJ is Jaguar.\"\nIllya Verpraet agreed but was rather more specific: \"The original Series 1 XJ6 was so beautiful that Jaguar then struggled to make anything that didn't look like it. It was the luxury limo that was cheaper than and out-handled and out-rode sports saloons of the day.\"\nLamborghini\nGallardo\n\n'Deafening silence', 'organised chaos', 'open secret' - all good examples of oxymorons. Here's another: 'baby Lambo'. It has been used historically to describe lower-order entrants to Sant'Agata's ranks, but it stopped making sense in 2003, when the Gallardo arrived with a howling V10, spaceship styling, at least 500bhp and specs to set alarms ringing in Maranello.\n\"It's not the best-looking, but to me it is the definitive Lamborghini,\" said Will Rimell, highlighting the earliest manual cars as a particular sweet spot. Murray Scullion picked the Gallardo because it turned Lambo from \"perennially skint to a supercar heavyweight\" and because it was \"achingly pretty and had a gated manual\". Let's all just ignore the Audi A4 switchgear.\nLancia\nStratos\n\nIt's just mad, isn't it? Forget, if you can, that it has a waspish Ferrari V6 buried in that stunning rear end; disregard the technical genius concealed within its drop-dead silhouette; and park the fact that it won the WRC three times on the trot. Just look at it. There you go: that's the main reason why the Stratos is our favourite Lancia.\n\"I'll never forget the sight and sound of a Stratos tearing up the gravel at Sweet Lamb on a bitter winter's night, doing as it was designed to do,\" said Jack Harrison. For Charlie Martin, the Stratos completely \"redefined what 'homologation special' meant\" and it has a legacy that far transcends mere motorsport prowess.\nLand Rover\nRange Rover\n\n\"When a car becomes a brand, it has done something right,\" said Mark Tisshaw, who sees the carving out of Range Rover into what is in effect a marque in its own right as a monument to the luxury 4x4's renown and all-round excellence. Every generation, he added, has been \"peerless on and off road\".\nThe current generation is so vastly capable and refined, in fact - \"blending effortless refinement with genuine all-terrain capability\", said Sam Phillips - that it's not just one of the best SUVs in the world but one of the best cars full stop.\nLotus\nElise\n\nIt says it all that the Elise is still viewed by so many as a definitive dynamic benchmark - the default lightweight sports car, even - three decades after its arrival. The no-frills featherweight did no less than completely upend the sports car market, and its legacy lives on through the massive influence its innovative design and engineering still has on car development today.\nMatt Saunders hailed the Elise for showing that \"Hethel could make a modern, technically innovative product\" but, importantly, doing so \"without sacrificing a jot on old-school, analogue sporting feel or on Chapman's core values of lightness and simplicity\". It's a true icon of British automotive excellence.\nMaserati\nMC12\n\nFrom early Formula 1 conquerors to achingly beautiful 1960s GTs and brutal V8 super-saloons, this isn't a brand short on bedroom poster material. But it's the wildest Maserati of all that gets our vote: the V12-wielding, Le Mans-honed MC12, which, said Charlie Martin, \"utterly ruined sports car racing through sheer domination - and looked gorgeous while doing it\".\n\"The greatest Maserati of all time should probably hail from the dim and distant, but how do you ignore the MC12?\" asked Richard Lane. \"Ferrari Enzo-derived mechanicals with a civilised cabin in stunning, GT1-inspired drag. Can you imagine if Maserati did similar today? They could charge £10 million for it.\"\nMazda\nMX-5\n\nYou knew it was coming. There was a smattering of nominations for the slightly esoteric RX-7, but the MX-5's victory here was nothing short of a landslide. There's a clever (if tired) US backronym that sums up the universal applicability of Mazda's roadster: 'Miata Is Always The Answer'.\nIts name may be different here, but the notion holds true: it isn't just one of the best-handling sports cars around, it's also one of the most affordable, efficient, well packaged, refined, well built and charming. And that has been pretty much true of every iteration. \"It's not easy to get something as pure as a two-seater roadster so right. That Mazda has delivered over multiple generations is remarkable,\" said James Attwood.\nKris Culmer credited the Mazda MX-5 as having \"single-handedly preserved the traditional roadster-and latterly also the affordable enthusiast's car\", adding: \"It's so much fun, and we all owe it a huge debt of gratitude.\"\nMercedes-Benz\nW123\n\nGerman taxi drivers' affinity for the W123 is a strong enough indication of reliability and rugged dependability, but that this granite-hewn executive express could spend years plying the autobahns and then go on to a second life tramping around North Africa for a few more decades makes the W123 well worthy of its 'unkillable' reputation. It's also just endlessly cool and supremely comfortable - which is why you still see minters trundling around rather more hospitable environs, such as Kensington or Tunbridge Wells.\nOf the hundreds of wildly varied legends in Merc's back catalogue, it was the W123 that \"arguably built the brand's worldwide reputation\", according to Alex Wolstenholme. \"They will last forever,\" he added. Yes, but only if you stop them getting too wet.\nMG\nZT-T 260\n\n\"The joy of dying brands\" for Illya Verpraet \"is they sometimes become delirious. Take the pipe-and-slippers, front-drive Rover 75 and re-engineer it to fit a longitudinal 4.6 V8 driving the rear wheels...\" His simplistic summary of the ZT-T 260's conception goes some way to explaining why we love it: it was just so ridiculously, wackily out of character- and a brilliantly extroverted swansong for a much-loved marque in its death throes.\nMatt Saunders agreed, saying: \"The 75 already had a fantastic chassis - although, for so long, any praise for it had to be qualified with terms like 'front-wheel drive' and 'K-series'. But when MG hit on the idea of a rear-drive version with a Mustang V8, no such qualifications were needed. Mad, needy and a little bit wonderful.\"\nMini\nMini-Minor\n\nWe don't use the phrase 'Concorde moment' lightly, but if ever there was a car equivalent, the original Mini - with the sort of genius packaging, engaging drivability and inherent accessibility that manufacturers still strive to replicate several decades after it died - was probably it. Mark Tisshaw called it \"a true icon\", with engineering that \"still feels impossible\".\nCar makers today can't build anything like it. It weighed just 600kg, sat four (sort of) comfortably and safely (ish), sipped fuel and drove with a zip and verve that made it the darling of the grassroots motorsport scene. Matt Prior said it was basically the default choice for our favourite Mini ever, because \"it was the only Mini for so long that only it could be the best\". Every new Mini since has tried, at least in part, to retain some of the original's character.\nNissan Skyline\nGT-R (R34)\n\nA halo car for a generation of car enthusiast and far more accessible than most to fans of all ages, courtesy of its role in the Gran Turismo racing game series. Here was an unfathomably capable V6 sports car that was unlike anything that had come before it and which you could drive from the comfort of your sofa at the age of 10.\nNot that it was so tameable in the real world, mind, cautioned Richard Lane: \"It's not the 'PlayStation on wheels' it's made out to be but rather emblematic of Nissan when the link from race track to road was incredibly strong. That makes it a properly rewarding driver's car.\" Kris Culmer agreed that the R34 \"was the peak of cool for petrolheads growing up in the early 2000s\" but reckoned that you had to have one in blue with gold wheels for the full experience. He's not fussy, though, if you're offering a go.\nPeugeot\n205\n\nOne of those cars that was so toweringly excellent in range-topping form that you could easily forget the cooking versions were just as brilliant. Everyone raves about the GTi, along with the lesser-known XS and Rallye variants, but there's a lot to be said for a humble 205 1.4 GR or even a lowly 1.1 Junior. Heck, even the non-turbocharged diesel GLD is a fine way of covering ground - so long as you're not late for an important appointment.\nJack Warrick credited the 205 as being the model \"that changed Peugeot's fortunes and public perception\" and added that its angular, oh-so-'80s silhouette has \"truly stood the test of time\". Sam Phillips agreed that the 205 was \"decent in all its forms\", but he couldn't resist marking out the GTi as \"one of the best driver's cars of all time\". No small praise, that, for a 40-year-old supermini.\nPorsche\n911\n\nThe Boxster is the cheapest, the Cayenne the most usable, the 356 the prettiest and the 918 the most technically impressive. But the most 'Porsche' of all the Porsches? There could only be one. \"It's not just the best Porsche, it's the Porsche that makes Porsche Porsche,\" said James Attwood of the Porsche 911 (forgetting that his surname dictates he should choose the 917K). \"And it's so famous you don't even need to say 'Porsche' for people to know what a 911 is.\"\nThese days, there are a dizzying number of variants from which to choose, ranging from entry-level Carrera up through 4S, T, GTS, Turbo, Turbo S, S/T, GT3 and GT3 RS-and that's to name but a few. And then certain versions can be chosen as a coupé, a cabriolet or a targa... It can all get a bit confusing if you're not fully invested. But the short of it is that all of them are excellent and supremely well rounded in their own ways.\nRenault\nClio\n\nEveryone has had one or at least been in one - but the Renault Clio's popular appeal and historic utilitarianism never came at the expense of its desirability. While some alternatives evolved into little more than drab, A-to-B appliances, Dieppe's take on the supermini always maintained a certain 'je ne sais quoi' over the decades, and even at its most humdrum it remains a thoroughly likeable little car. Just ask Nicole.\nOr ask Matt Saunders, who said it was perhaps \"the first of the modern 'designer' superminis, proving that a dash of style and verve could go a very long way on a little car\". It's a notion into which the designers of the extroverted latest-generation car have really leaned, for better or worse.\nSkoda\nSuperb\n\nNominative determinism at its very best here. Has there been any other car so aptly badged? At the heart of the Superb's acclaim is that it's almost impossible to not recommend - to almost anyone. Yes, it's perfect for motorway-plying families and itinerant execs, but you needn't fit either category to be won over by its blend of no-nonsense ergonomics, supreme refinement and - in most forms-remarkable frugality.\nWill Rimell is head over heels: \"It's the best mile-muncher there is: comfortable, economical and spacious, with heaps of buttons that do what you think they should. I'm sure there are people who say this isn't the best all-rounder on sale. I'm also sure they are wrong.\"\nToyota\nGT86\n\nMost of us have a 'top 10 favourite cars' in mind, shuffling things in and out day by day and rarely giving the same answer twice - but the tail-happy GT86 is one of those unfathomably rare cars that seems to have earned itself a permanent place on everyone's leaderboard.\nIllya Verpraet said: \"An image of boringness is notoriously hard to shake off, but Toyota managed it with the GT86. Here was the real-world usable sports car of our dreams, with the right footprint, right amount of power and right amount of grip.\" He lamented only that its improved GR86 successor was available in such limited numbers. Saunders touched on a slightly awkward truth: \"It was built in a Subaru factory and was powered by a low-lying Subaru flat four, which gave it key dynamic advantages.\" Nonetheless, he added: \"It's hard to think of a car that altered perceptions of its maker quite so powerfully.\"\nVauxhall\nCorsa\n\nAs one of the less 'enthusiast-oriented' marques on this list, Vauxhall doesn't have a bulging portfolio of legendary past models to draw from when it comes to choosing a top hit. But it is perhaps the brand to which most people have been directly exposed, and there is no model more representative of its mammoth cultural impact than the Vauxhall Corsa. I learned to drive in one, and nearly all my mates had one when we were in sixth form. It has always felt a little staid next to Ford's Fiesta, but I admire its understated handsomeness and universal appeal.\nSo does James Attwood: \"The Corsa hasn't always been a great car, but it always delivered on its supermini brief. It's a mass-market crowd-pleaser in the best way.\" Plus, remember when Vauxhall went a bit mad with the absolutely wild VXR Nurbürgring edition? It's always the quiet ones... \"Come on!\" etc.\nVolkswagen\nGolf\n\nWhat more can be said about the VW Golf? It's about as close to the distilled essence of 'car' as you can get. \"Excellent at everything yet always entirely modest,\" as Kris Culmer put it. Practical in all of its forms, well built and attractive in (almost) every generation, generally affordable and sensibly packaged: half a century on from its conception, the Golf remains the reference point for how to make an everyday family car.\n\"When someone doesn't know what car to choose, you tell them to buy a Golf in a form that suits them,\" said Mark Tisshaw. That nails it.\nVolvo\n850\n\nWas Huey Lewis right? Can it really be hip to be square? You try looking at the 850 and arguing otherwise. This \"pinnacle of brilliantly boxy Volvo design\", said James Attwood, is one of the, er, hippest cars ever made. There was a wheel-cocking BTCC version, too, which \"made it incredibly cool\".\nIt's a forgotten seminal sports estate as well, in slightly silly R form - with 247bhp giving a 0-62mph sprint time of 6.7sec, which sounds pretty sprightly even today. Plus it was built like a tank, had a colossal boot and, as Jack 'Safety First' Warrick excitedly reminded us, \"was the first mass-production car with side airbags\". And if that doesn't make you want one...",

      "summary": "Entry-level electric crossover will be shown at Brussels motor show alongside GT variants for EV3, EV4 and EV5\n\nKia has released the first images of the EV2, its new entry-level electric car, ahead of its reveal tomorrow (9 January).\nThree pictures published on social media reveal it retains key cues from the EV2 Concept shown last year, including its fang-like headlights and low-set brake lights.\nThe Renault 4 rival will make its debut at the Brussels motor show, when Kia will also unveil new range-topping GT variants of the EV3, EV4 and EV5.\nPowertrain details have still to be revealed, but the EV2 will sit on the same modular E-GMP architecture as the rest of Kia’s EV-badged range. As such, it is expected to be a similar offering to that of the EV3, which gets a 201bhp front motor and can be specced with either a 58.3kWh or 81.4kWh battery for a maximum range of 375 miles (WLTP).\nIts cabin will also be similar to the EV3's, which sports a 12.3in driver’s display, a 12.3in central touchscreen and a 5.3in climate display. \nThe EV2 has been designed and developed in Europe and will be built at the car maker’s Slovakian plant, which also produces the Sportage.\nMarc Hedrich, Kia Europe boss, said the EV2 “delivers the innovation and the spirit of our larger EVs” and will “play a pivotal role in shaping the future of responsible mobility across the region”.\nPricing, alongside full technical details, will be released when the car is unveiled. For reference, the EV3, which it will sit underneath, starts at £32,995. The Renault 4, one of the EV2's key rivals, starts from £23,445.",

      "title": "Volvo EX60 to become UK's longest-legged EV with 503-mile range",
      "summary": "Electric equivalent of best-selling XC60 can drive from London to Dundee without stopping to recharge\n\nVolvo has confirmed that the forthcoming EX60 electric SUV will offer 503 miles of range between charges, which will make it the longest-legged EV on sale in the UK.\nThat is thanks in part to a large, 106kWh battery, though the EX60 is also more efficient than the rival BMW iX3, which gets 500 miles of range from a 108.7kWh (usable capacity) pack.\nIt is enough range to drive from London to Dundee (480 miles) without stopping to charge or, as Volvo notes, from Paris to Amsterdam.\nThe EX60 will also be capable of recharging at up to 400kW, refilling 211 miles of range within 10 minutes at a suitably fast charger. \nVolvo said the EX60, due to be unveiled on 21 January, is intended to be a \"no-compromises electric car\" and will form the \"cornerstone\" of the brand's future line-up.  \nThough much remains to be revealed, the model appears to have a low bonnet line and a smoother, more aerodynamic design than its combustion-engined counterpart, the XC60.\nNarrow front headlights featuring Volvo's 'Thor's hammer' design, similar to those on the EX90 large SUV, can also be seen in preview images of the car.\nVolvo CEO Håkan Samuelsson previously said the EX60 has been \"designed and developed in Gothenburg\" and \"can't get much more Swedish\". \n\nThe new technology base that the EX60 will use is Volvo's advanced, highly scalable SPA3 platform, which is effectively a successor to the platform that underpins the EX90 and ES90 saloon. This new architecture will allow Volvo to add both smaller and larger cars to its line-up and can accommodate a wide range of battery sizes.\nAs with those models, the EX60 will be designed around an advanced software stack, giving it the capability to accept over-the-air updates and extra features.\nAnders Bell, Volvo's engineering and technology chief, called the SPA3 platform \"100% electric and 100% Volvo Cars\", rather than a platform shared with other brands owned by Chinese giant and Volvo parent Geely, such as the SEA platform used for the smaller EX30 crossover.\n\"Because it's 100% electric, we've been able to remove all the old constraints of the combustion engine,\" said Bell. \"We very much took a first-principles approach to it. You will see the highest level of supremely well-integrated technology coming together in these products.\"\nThe EX60 is likely to broadly match the dimensions of the XC60 (pictured below), the brand's best-selling car.\n\nBell said the SPA3 is “a big step from a mechanical perspective, but from a software electronics perspective it's a straight evolution”.\nHe added: “All the work we're putting into the EX90 will go directly into the SPA3 cars as well. It's basically the same software stack.\n\"SPA3 is designed from the beginning to be much more scalable, in size and price point and across regions, but also scalable in volume.\n\"It's designed for scale in every dimension: when it comes to size, my job is to make sure that the company has optionality. We are designing [the SPA3] to be scalable from B to F [segments], to make sure that we have flexibility and that we can launch the products that markets decide they want when they want it.”\nSince all future new Volvo models will share the same basic tech stack, Bell added that it will allow for more focused and rapid development. “Because it’s all one technology stack, there's no repeat of work,” he said. “It's the same software stack, same basic electrical architecture. Yes, it's scalable in size, price and capabilities, but it's not spreading our products in different ecosystems. \n“Everything we do gets married to the Volvo connected car cloud. If you look at successful tech companies, they're all single tech stack companies where all their products are interlinked. Apple is a good example: hardware, software, telephones, laptops – they’re basically all interconnected with the same software. That’s one example of where we need to be converging as a technology company going forward.\n\"Our focal point is safety, sustainability and creating this fantastic customer experience, all wrapped in this Scandinavian design, on one tech stack.\"\nAs previously revealed by Autocar, the EX60 will also be the first Volvo designed to benefit from megacasting – a technology set to be introduced with the SPA3 that allows for entire sections of a car to be created as a single part rather than multiple elements.\nThat, along with other changes and the more modular nature of the SPA3, will lower production costs.\nWhen it arrives, Volvo's EV line-up in Europe will consist of the EX30, EC40, EX40, EX60, ES90 and EX90, with the addition of the EM90 MPV in China.",

      "summary": "Movers and shakers: Renault Group UK’s head of sales operations Lina Ribeiro moves to Romanian brand\n\n\n\nWelcome to Movers and Shakers, an Autocar Business feature covering the latest job moves from across the automotive industry.\nThis page is updated regularly with all the biggest transfers, promotions and departures in the sector, covering everything you need to know.\nName: Lina Ribeiro\nCompany: Dacia\nRole: UK brand director\n\nDacia has named Renault Group UK’s head of sales operations Lina Ribeiro as its new UK brand director. \nShe is tasked with overseeing the brand following one of its biggest years to date, topped by the arrival of the new Bigster SUV.\nRibeiro succeeds Luke Broad who has been promoted to managing director of Retail Renault Group UK.\nShe takes on the role following more than 20 years in the automotive industry. This includes multiple strategic roles in the UK and abroad, which has seen her lead teams and launch initiatives in sales, operations, network development, and customer experience.\nIn her current role at Renault Group UK, she has led teams through strong periods of growth thanks to her straightforward, consistent and quietly inventive leadership style.\nRibeiro said: “It’s a real privilege to step into this role and continue shaping the next chapter of Dacia’s success in the UK. \n“The brand keeps going from strength to strength, always standing for something bigger when it comes to mobility. I’m excited to carry that forward, challenging conventions and delivering meaningful value to our customers.”\nKatrin Adt, Dacia CEO, said of Ribeiro’s appointment: “I’m pleased to welcome Lina into her new role. As Dacia continues to grow, her leadership will strengthen our momentum in a market that values affordability and durability in vehicles built for the real-world.”\nName: Soohang Chang\nCompany: Kia Europe\nRole: President and CEO\n\nSoohang Chang has been named president and CEO of Kia Europe. He moves from being head of the Korean car maker’s Middle East and Africa region.\nHe will officially begin the role on 1 January, taking over from Marc Hedrich, who moves back to his home country to become president of Kia France, a role he held between 2021 and 2023, replacing Tae Kun Yang.\nIn his new role, Chang is tasked with accelerating Kia’s electrification, which will begin with launching the EV2 – the Korean firm’s new entry-level model, which will be unveiled at the Brussels motor show on 9 January.\n“His proven ability to deliver results in diverse markets positions him to navigate the evolving European automotive landscape and drive Kia’s long-term growth in one of the world’s most dynamic regions,” Kia said of Chang.\nOf Hedrich, the company said: “His leadership will guide Kia France through its next phase of growth and strengthen the brand’s position in one of Europe’s most competitive markets. His deep understanding of local consumer trends and regulatory dynamics, combined with his prior achievements, make this a strategic move for Kia.”\nName: Alexander Karajlovic\nCompany: BMW M\nRole: Vice-president for development\n\nBMW XM project manager Alexander Karajlovic (pictured above) has been appointed as the new vice-president of development for BMW's M division, following the retirement of Dirk Häcker.\nKarajlovic was responsible for the M versions of BMW's SUVs as well as the XM – the go-faster division's first bespoke product since 1978 – between late 2017 and late 2020.\nHe later managed BMW M's product line-up and was most recently the vice-president of driving experience integration for the BMW Group.\nKarajlovic has big shoes to fill in replacing Häcker, who can be credited with much of the M division's success since he took charge of its R&D in 2015.\nSince then, the brand has set several sales records and produced benchmark-setting driver's cars, including the previous-generation BMW M5 CS and BMW M2 CS. \nHäcker also played a significant role in developing the first battery-electric M-car, the next-generation M3.\nAlongside his corporate responsibilities, Häcker was an instructor for the BMW M Driving Experience. \nBMW M CEO Frank van Meel said Häcker's retirement is \"well earned\" and \"his name is inextricably linked with an unprecedented product offensive, superior product quality and yearly sales records at BMW M\".\nVan Meel added that Karajlovic brings a \"proven track record of chassis development know-how\".\nName: Steve Catlin\nCompany: Vauxhall\nRole: Managing director\n\nVauxhall MD Steve Catlin has stepped down from the role just six months after being appointed. The British brand said this was due to personal reasons.\nCatlin has been replaced by parent company Stellantis’s UK boss, Eurig Druce. He will take on the role alongside his other responsibilities.\nIt isn't yet known whether Stellantis will look to find a more permanent replacement for Catlin.\nOn the reason for Druce stepping into the Vauxhall hot seat, Stellantis said it was down to “recognising the importance of the Vauxhall brand to Stellantis UK’s overall performance“.\nDruce said: “Vauxhall is a British brand with a proud history. It’s the home brand for the group and, despite an onslaught of new competition, is increasing its market share.”\nDruce takes on the role at a pivotal time for Vauxhall as the onslaught of cheaper, Chinese car makers continue to flood into the market. \nJust last month, Catlin told Autocar that he wanted the UK government to create \"a fair playing field\" and look into whether Chinese car makers were using state subsidies to undermine established brands.\nIn the most recent figures, Vauxhall sat 11th in the UK new car sales standings, notably behind MG and just ahead of Omoda/Jaecoo.\nName: Bob Laishley\nCompany: Caterham\nRole: CEO/COO\n\nCaterham CEO Bob Laishley has stepped down with immediate effect after four and a half years in the role.\nHe is replaced by Kazuho Takahashi, president and founder of parent company VT Holdings. Day-to-day operations will be managed by chief financial officer and operations director Trevor Steel.\nLaishley joined the firm fron Nissan when the Japanese importer group took ownership in 2021. In the role of chief strategic officer, he was tasked with steadying the transition. In 2022, he took on the joint role of CEO and COO, following the retirement of Graham Macdonald.\nDuring his time, Laishley most notably oversaw Caterham’s move to its “game-changing” new Dartford plant last year, which increased capacity to 750 cars a year and opened the firm up to more export markets.\nTakahashi said: “I would like to thank Bob, on behalf of everyone at Caterham, for his work over the last four years. He has played an important role in overseeing the move to our new global headquarters in Dartford and securing the long-term future of our iconic car.”\nName: Luigi Ksawery Luca\nCompany: Toyota UK\nRole: President and managing director\n\nToyota has appointed Luigi Ksawery Luca as the new boss of its UK division.\nThe Italian will take on the role from 1 January, succeeding Scott Thompson who has been at the helm since the start of 2024. Thompson will return to Toyota Australia.\nLuca has been at Toyota GB since September, where he has been in an executive advisor post. Previously he worked for Toyota Motor Europe as vice-president of customer experience and business transformation and, prior to that, was boss of Toyota Italy.  \nLuca said: “Scott has been an inspirational leader, successfully implementing our multipath strategy and navigating the challenges and opportunities of the dynamic UK market.\n\"I look forward to stepping into the role, grasping the opportunities that the evolution of the UK market provides and creating further synergies between UK-based Toyota companies.”\nName: Peter Kronschnabl\nCompany: Genesis\nRole: Europe MD\n\nGenesis has named Peter Kronschnabl as its new Europe managing director, succeeding Xavier Martinet, who had been leading the brand alongside his responsibilities as Hyundai Motor Europe CEO. \nKronschnabl joins the Korean firm after 30 years with BMW, during which time he led the German brand's operations in markets including Africa, the Caribbean, India, Russia, Benelux and Japan.\nMost recently, he was BMW's vice president of market development and special sales, a role in which he led the brand's expansion into emerging markets - experience that will no doubt serve him well as he steers Hyundai's premium marque into crucial new global markets.\nGenesis recently confirmed a dramatic expansion of its European market coverage, with plans to launch in France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands from early next year, having already established itself in the UK, Germany and Switzerland.\nKronschnabl will also be at the helm as Genesis takes to the grid for the first time in the World Endurance Championship next year, launches the GV60 Magma as its first dedicated performance car and introduces a new range of hybrid models. \nKronschnabl said: \"Genesis is an exciting brand with strong foundations, a passionate team and a unique position in the market. With its distinct Korean spirit, design-driven performance values and a premium all-electric model line-up, I look forward to replicating the customer demand and growing success seen already in Korea and the US.  \n\"The future Magma and hybrid products, Genesis Magma Racing programme and market expansion plans will all provide great opportunities to really drive Genesis into its next chapter in Europe.”\nName: Jim Rowan\nCompany: Lotus\nRole: Board member\n\nFormer Volvo CEO Jim Rowan has been appointed to the board of Lotus.\nThe Scotsman stepped down from the helm of Volvo in March following a tenure that lasted three years. He was replaced by his predecessor, Håkan Samuelsson, on an interim basis.\nRowan has now moved to Lotus, which is also owned by Geely. He joins during a period of uncertainty at the British-Chinese brand, which includes job cuts and suggestions it could end production at Hethel.\nWriting on social media platform LinkedIn, the Scotsman said Lotus is “one of the few car brands today with real heritage”.\nHe added: “Today the company has some of the most advanced hybrid and pure EV propulsion and software technology in the world. \n“With the full support of the Geely group, the company is well positioned for the challenges and opportunities that face today’s global automotive industry.”",

      "title": "Who actually deserves the Car of the Year title in 2026?",
      "summary": "Six crossovers and one saloon, but only one really stands out as a deserving victor\n\nIf you want to do the fairest and most scrupulous job as a road tester, to reconfirm an impression or be sure about a relative strength or weakness, the best thing is simply to start over. Rinse and repeat. Come with a fresh set of senses and just give the cars on which you're about to pronounce one more chance.\nThe more important the pronouncement, of course, the stronger the case to hit the reset button. That's why, come the darkest winter months, the UK-based jurors for the Car of the Year award gather together the seven new cars that have made the competition's final shortlist – the result of an initial round of voting in the early autumn – and engage in a fresh set of back-to-back driving on the roads around Silverstone circuit.\nThey may be cars already quite well known to most of those voting, but back-to-back comparison on the most relevant kinds of roads never fails to be revealing. This year, it was my turn to attend on behalf of Autocar, and the shortlisted cars were the Citroën C5 Aircross, Dacia Bigster, Fiat Grande Panda, Kia EV4, Mercedes-Benz CLA, Renault 4 and Skoda Elroq.\nIf I tried to tell you something meaningful about all seven of them within the span of this column, I wouldn't do justice to any of them. So instead I'll focus on the three that I think are the likeliest to contend for the podium places when all of the votes are collected and the result is announced later this week.\nStep forward, then, the CLA, Elroq and Grande Panda. Any one of them could be the 2026 Car of the Year winner.\nThe Mercedes because it seems to advance the art of the possible for the electric car, at least to some extent; the Fiat because it's a classic COTY favourite, representing the sorts of values that the competition's jurors have responded to so many times over the years; and the Skoda just because it's such a singularly well-rounded, versatile and pleasant family car for a reasonable price.\nWe road tested the EQ electric version recently, and I confess that I was a little bit surprised that the range and efficiency numbers it posted weren't better. That might be something to do with the particular speeds at which we happen to benchmark efficiency, though.\nI was pleasantly surprised at Silverstone, at any rate, at the way in which this car, with its two-speed gearbox, could maintain its efficiency on the motorway – where so many EVs can't – without running on the type of efficiency-skewed tyres that adversely impact ride and handling.\nThe truth is that this Mercedes isn't at all one-dimensional. It steers and handles sweetly and has a way of carrying momentum that makes you feel like you're getting extra value out of every mote of energy consumed. That's how EVs should feel, surely.\nIf the Mercedes had the same completeness as the Skoda, it would be the clear favourite for me. But I was less convinced about its rear cabin space and likewise the rather mixed impression for material quality of its suspiciously glossy, plasticky fascia.\nThe Elroq, by contrast, just feels like the Mk7 Volkswagen Golf of the electric C-segment. It's such a competent car: roomier and more comfortable than the Renault, more refined and settled-riding than the Kia, grown-up and substantial in its character and deportment, well finished and easy to drive.\nThere's nothing it does badly; no real compromise that it asks you to make. The Grande Panda will end up being there or thereabouts when the votes are counted, because it will benefit from a certain amount of sentimentality, but it's far from undeserving.\nCOTY jurors have a history of preferring more accessible cars to pricier ones, and the little Fiat is great value, a superb bit of product design and a perfectly competent car to drive.\nBut I wonder whether it has the real universality of the feted original Panda – or if Fiat could, and should, have committed harder to a broader product range to really deliver on its potential.\nIt's a hard field to predict this year but, gun to the head, I'd say the Elroq is most deserving, if it isn't a bit too dowdy and mature for its own good. Soon enough, all will be revealed.",

      "title": "Jeep Wrangler tipped for UK return – eventually",
      "summary": "Non-compliance with safety regulations, plus high emissions, forced the 4x4 to be pulled from sale\n\nThe Jeep Wrangler is tipped for an eventual return to the UK market, but not before its safety and environmental credentials are improved. \nThe brand’s flagship 4x4 was recently withdrawn from sale because it was not compliant with the European Union’s GSR2 regulations. These concern the fitment of certain driver assistance and monitoring systems, as well as tougher cybersecurity requirements.\nIts large CO2 output of 269g/km also undermined the case for keeping it on sale, with manufacturers having been incentivised to make swingeing cuts to their fleet emissions averages by the ZEV mandate.\nUnder the mandate, manufacturers can trade significant reductions in the total CO2 output of all the cars they sell each year for de facto EV ‘sales’. Each 167g/km saved can be used to offset one EV sale, so for each Wrangler that Jeep does not sell, parent company Stellantis effectively ‘sells’ 1.6 electric cars.\nAccording to trade body the Society of Motor Manufacturers of Traders, car makers missed the mandate’s EV sales target in 2025 – the second year in a row. And with the EV sales target rising from 28% to 33% this year, pressure is mounting for manufacturers to make gains wherever they can to hit the goal. The fine for missing it is £12,000 per combustion-engined car sold over the threshold.\nThis year also marks the introduction of the Euro 7 emissions standard, which will for the first time regulate emissions from tyres and brakes, and in a wider range of conditions.\n“In the short term, we have paused production under regulatory and responsible pressure, with the current CO2 output of [the Wrangler]. We’re not building any more this year,” Jeep UK managing director Kris Cholmondeley told Autocar. “What we’re not saying is that this car will not return in an evolved guise in the short to medium term. I don’t know what and when, but it’s such an iconic car.”\nAsked how Jeep can maintain the positive sales momentum it has gathered over the past two years without its flagship model, Cholmondeley said: “Wrangler has been an enduring icon, but it has always been niche. That's lovely for the heart – [but] in terms of the ongoing viability, a good brand can die by being too niche and not having a broader commercial appeal.\n“Our job is to protect the core and the spirit and broaden the appeal. So I love Wrangler and everything it stands for, but I also love Avenger and Compass. They’ve got all that Jeep DNA running through them, but they've got much broader appeal. And for me, it's about a balanced portfolio, rather than something that only speaks to the heart.”\nCholmondeley added that decisions have not yet been made on when the new Recon – an electric 4x4 adjacent to the Wrangler – will arrive in the UK, nor the new Cherokee or Wagoneer S. “Building cars in America in recent times has become more challenging in terms of short- to medium-term planning. We don't have timings and details on those cars, so right now all my efforts are making sure that we maximise Avenger and Compass, because [they cover] 50% of the market.”",
