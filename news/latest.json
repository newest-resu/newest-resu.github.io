The very best estate cars are also better to drive than their high-riding counterparts. \nDiversity abounds within the estate market, too: you can have a simple, mile-munching diesel to satisfy the cliché of being “all the car you’ll ever need”, or you can have a luxurious shooting brake offering excellent ride comfort – and if you want a sweet-handling derivative with supercar-baiting perfromance, there are plenty of those to choose from too. \nUltimately there’s an estate car that will suit your needs, but right now we think the Skoda Superb Estate is the best you can buy today. Its capacious boot, versatile powertrain line-up and pleasing driving dynamics helped it secure a five-star road test verdict. \nBut there’s a plethora of other models worth considering, so read on as we list the 10 best estate cars on sale in the UK today.",

      "title": "Talking trash: How Dennis Eagle made Britain a bin lorry big-shot",
      "summary": "Dennis Eagle currently makes about 32 lorries of varying types each week\n\n\nLeamington Spa-based firm can trace routes back to 1895 when it started making chassis for fire engines \n\n\"Whenever we say to people we work at Dennis Eagle, they say: 'Dennis? Oh, the fire engines.\"\nAs reputations go, you could do worse than be associated with producing emergency response vehicles, but if you haven't actually had anything to do with them for more than two decades, and have since become a market leader in quite another area, the misconception is probably a bit frustrating.\n\"It wasn't us that manufactured the fire engine. We manufactured the cabin at our plant in Blackpool, yes, but it was in 2004 they stopped manufacturing it,\" explains the company's managing director, Keith Day. \"We've got thousands of these driving around the streets now that seem to be invisible,\" he says, gesturing out of the window of the firm's Warwickshire factory at the ranks of gleaming new bin lorries awaiting delivery to their new owners.\n\nDennis Eagle, like all the very best automotive-adjacent institutions (cough), was started in 1895, originally as Dennis Brothers, a maker of lawnmowers and bikes that later branched out into building chassis for a wide range of commercial vehicles, including - you guessed it-fire engines.\nToday's company was formed in the mid-1980s when Dennis merged with vehicle body manufacturer Eagle Engineering and opened a factory in Leamington Spa, which over the past four decades has grown to become one of the country's most important vehicle plants.\n\nThe site currently produces roughly 32 lorries a week of various shapes and sizes - mostly derivatives of Dennis Eagle's own Elite and electric eCollect models, but the firm is more than happy to plop one of its bodies on the back of a chassis cab from Mercedes, Volvo or Scania, some of its biggest rivals in the sector.\nThe company builds almost everything in the UK, where it employs more than 1000 people - and the domestic market is its biggest, accounting for around 80% of its total output.\nThis thriving operation is an unusually reassuring indication of the health of UK industry and Day thinks the firm's commitment to local manufacturing is a key ingredient of its success. \"We're very UK-centric from a customer point of view - and people buy from people,\" he tells us, having taken a quick break from giving a factory tour to a gaggle of representatives from one of London's biggest boroughs.\n\"It really helps when you can bring customers on to the manufacturing site and show them around: they can meet the people and that helps to establish that relationship with customers,\" he says. Certainly, our own access-all-areas tour of the facility is exciting enough to instil in me a new-found sense of appreciation and admiration for these 'invisible' heroes of UK infrastructure.\nOur first stop is the chassis assembly hall, where 50 workers zip nimbly between the rails of limo-length ladder frames, routing brake systems, nipping up fuel lines, connecting up driveshafts and finally sliding the whole assembly underneath a cab - all mostly by hand.\n\nEven at this early stage, it's plain to see just how much variation there is between each order: there are standard-length chassis with three axles and shorter twin-axle variants for the world's tightest city streets; some frames are black while others are 'Veolia grey'; and some even have entirely bespoke suspension and tyre specs. \"We had a really interesting one that we built up for collecting refuse on a beach. It looked like a monster truck,\" recalls sales and marketing boss Lee Rowland.\nHe says part of the reason that the assembly procedure remains so \"incredibly manual\", even as the trucks themselves become increasingly complex and automated, is that it affords Dennis Eagle the flexibility it needs to cater to the wildly different needs of its customers.\n\"No two councils collect waste the same way, so no two contracts for trucks are the same. They all have very slight differences and variations and we've always been very, very good at accommodating it,\" says Rowland. \"That customer focus side is quite important. It's necessary for the market,\" he adds.\nThe ethos of flexibility carries over into building two, where hulking bodyshells - some the size of small bungalows, at 27,000 litres - are being noisily, smokily bent and welded into shape, ready to be filled with all manner of intimidating-looking mechanisms for separating, crushing and unloading rubbish.\nAfter that, it's on to one of the gargantuan paint booths to be decorated in the chosen livery of their buyers (split roughly 50:50 between councils and private contractors) and, finally, the finished articles are parked up for a rigorous round of pre-delivery testing and evaluation.\nIt's a fascinating and precise production process that has been honed over decades, seemingly to the point of perfection, and it's only set to get busier - with plans to start increasing output of chassis and body components from early next year and capacity beyond that to add a whole second shift if it's ever needed.\n\nOf all the different strands of the automotive industry, surely this must be one of the more 'future-proof, I posit to Day, given society's ceaseless propensity to generate ever-greater mounds of waste. \"There's always going to be a requirement for it,\" he agrees, adding that there's plenty of scope for development, too, to explore new and more efficient ways of collecting, separating, sorting and disposing of all the different types of rubbish.\nCrucially, though, even as Dennis Eagle eyes a future of stable growth, it won't stray far from what it does best. \"The vision statement is 'innovative refuse collection vehicles for safer, cleaner communities' - and that's our niche. We've got to understand what our niche is and really focus on that,\" says Day.\n\"The danger is that if you try to move away from that, you get distracted and you can end up spending a lot of money on something that's not going to be cheaper.\" The outlook, then, is totally rubbish - and Dennis Eagle couldn't be happier about it.\nSo what's it like to drive?\n\"If you can drive a car, you can drive one of these,\" says Tony Darby, dispatch co-ordinator for Dennis Eagle's pre-delivery inspection team, as he pivots a brand-spankers Elite+ deftly around a tightly packed Warwick housing estate.\n\nFresh from the production line, this six-wheeler is just a few days from entering service with Hinckley & Bosworth Borough Council and it's a stark demonstration of just how far bin lorries have come since the early days. USB ports, massive cupholders, Bluetooth surround-sound audio, iPad mounts, ambient lighting - we've got all the mod cons of the average premium SUV in here and it certainly doesn't feel all that different from a modern car in its manoeuvrability and pace.\n\"Oh, they've got some speed on them,\" says Darby as he winds up the 7.7-litre Volvo diesel engine for a stretch of dual carriageway and we surge effortlessly from 30-50mph. Minutes later, the Elite impresses again when we reach the end of a cul-de-sac and Darby spins it around about as quickly and easily as if he was driving a Ford Fiesta.\nNext time you're whining about being woken up when the bins are collected at 6am, remember: those are among the UK's best drivers and most amazing machines out there.",

      "title": "My Lancia Delta HF Turbo was left to me in my grandad's will",
      "summary": "This hot Delta may not be an Integrale, but it’s still fantastic fun to drive \n\nWhile many car enthusiasts have taken the plunge and put their hand in their pocket for their chosen car, Simon Webling is one of the few who was lucky enough to inherit his, a Lancia Delta HF Turbo. \n\"It was my grandfather's car,\" he says. \"He bought it new in 1988, trading in his Lotus Esprit Turbo, which had been expensive to run and very unreliable. He taught me to drive in the Delta and we spent many happy times together with the car. So when, sadly, he died three years ago, it came into my hands. I couldn't see it be sold: it holds too many memories.\" \nThis hot Delta was registered in 1988 but has done just 56,000 miles. In addition to it being garaged for most of its life, this explains why the car is in such good condition - for a Lancia. \n\"There's a little bit of rust bubbling on a door bottom and around the filler, but otherwise it's in lovely condition,\" says Simon. \"My grandfather sent off one of the headlamp-washer motors to be repaired by someone but never got it back, so I've removed the washer arms on both sides, hence the grille holes. The electric front windows don't work, but come on, it's Italian!\" \n\nBefore the HF 4WD and the HF Integrale came along, the HF Turbo was top dog in the Delta range. Simon's is powered by a 1.6-litre turbocharged four that produces 138bhp. \"I recall it feeling quicker,\" says Simon. \"Of late, it has started to feel a bit flat. I plan to take it to Tanc Barratt, a Delta specialist in Wales, to have it looked at.\" \nIf you think Simon's grandfather had the Martini decals applied later, in fact they were a factory option that first appeared in 1984 to celebrate the WRC victories of the mid-engined Rally 037. Remarkably, though, what isn't original is the interior layout. \"It was converted to right-hand drive by a Lancia dealer,\" explains Simon. \n\"They had to swap the dashboards, but they didn't extended the wiring and cabling, causing them to be stretched or trapped between panels. Many cars suffered electrical problems.\" \nThe original HF model had an understated look, so Lancia used the HF Turbo's launch in 1985 to put that right, giving it side skirts and the name picked out in red on the radiator grille. The Delta's 1986 facelift brought a smarter grille with integrated foglights and new eight-hole alloy wheels. \n\nHowever, as Simon explains, some other features were just for show: \"The lower grille simply feeds air to the interior, rather than the engine, while one of the two trailing-edge air scoops on the bonnet is blocked off.\" \nSimon isn't short of tasty machinery. His daily driver is a 2016 Mercedes-Benz C350e, while his other 'toys' are a 2005 Subaru Impreza Turbo for track days and a 2009 Ducati 848 motorcycle (he marshals at the Isle of Man TT). Nevertheless, and despite its temporary drop in power, he loves driving the Delta. \n\"It wobbles a bit on its old suspension, but it's otherwise lovely to drive and fun to chuck around,\" says Simon. \n\"It rattles badly, though. My grandfather stuffed pieces of sponge between the panels in a bid to quieten it, but I've taken them out and accept that's a Delta for you!\"",

      "summary": "Ingenlath designed Volvo's entire line-up before leaving to lead Polestar\n\n\nDesigner of XC40, XC90 and V90 returns to Volvo after seven years leading EV offshoot Polestar\n\nThomas Ingenlath has returned to his old role as chief designer at Volvo, nine years after leaving the Swedish brand to run its EV sibling Polestar.\nIngenlath originally became Volvo's lead designer in 2012. In his five-year tenure in that role, he was responsible for a complete stylistic overhaul that defined the look of crucial models including the XC90, V90 and XC40. \nThe German also designed the future-looking Concept Coupé (below) and Concept 40.2, which would go on to become the Polestar 1 and Polestar 2 respectively.\nIn 2017, he was named the CEO of Polestar ahead of it being hived off from Volvo and operating as a car maker in its own right. \n\nHe managed Polestar – and continued to play an influential role in its design strategy – for seven years, expanding its portfolio with the introduction of the Polestar 3 and Polestar 4 crossovers and strengthening its global retail footing with commercial launches in 27 markets.\nAfter leaving Polestar, he was named a design advisor for the wider Geely group, but is now returning to Volvo to lead the design of its next-generation line-up, following the departure of Jeremy Offer.\nVolvo said Ingenlath's appointment as chief design officer (his previous title was senior vice-president of design) \"marks the return of one of the most influential designers in the company’s recent history and reinforces Volvo Cars’ leadership in design\".\n\nNotably, Ingenlath will again work alongside Håkan Samuelsson, who was Volvo's CEO during his initial tenure as design boss, before stepping down in 2022 and then returning in 2025.\nIngenlath will be tasked with shaping Volvo's future beyond its current line-up (largely designed during his previous stint at the firm). But with each of its models having only recently been renewed or updated and the best-selling XC60 shortly to gain a new electric equivalent, the EX60, he will probably be looking well into the future initially. \nHe said: “I am delighted to be returning to Volvo Cars. Design is fundamental to what Volvo stands for. I look forward to working closely with the teams across the company, developing cars that are distinct, relevant and true to the Volvo brand.”\nBefore joining Volvo in 2012, Ingenlath played various leading design roles across the Volkswagen Group, most notably at Skoda, where he was responsible for the Mk1 Superb, Mk2 Fabia, Roomster MPV and seminal Yeti crossover.",

      "summary": "Simplest version of small crossover could become one of the nation’s cheapest new cars\n\nFiat will bring the most affordable version of the new Grande Panda, fitted with a pure-petrol engine and a manual gearbox, to the UK. \nThe powertrain comprises a 1.2-litre turbocharged three-cylinder engine that sends 99bhp and 151lb ft of torque to the front wheels via a six-speed shifter.\nFiat UK’s managing director, Kris Cholmondeley, told Autocar that it will be priced at “an even lower, better price point” than the £18,995 hybrid.\nIn its native Italy, the pure-petrol Grande Panda is €2000 (£1700) cheaper than the hybrid, suggesting that it could arrive in the UK at around £17,000. That would make it one of the nation's cheapest new cars.\nFiat UK has yet to confirm when the model will go on sale but, given the hybrid and electric versions have been delayed until March, it's unlikely to land in showrooms until much later this year.\nWhen it arrives, it will join a petrol manual version of the larger Fiat 600 crossover. This is due in the third quarter of the year, alongside the new petrol manual Fiat 500 Hybrid.\nCholmondeley said the addition of several more affordable, petrol manual models “screams everything about Fiat: value, style, the way it makes you feel”.\n“We haven’t had enough petrol manuals in cars [in recent years],” he continued. “It’s a massive part of the segment, and that is definitely coming.”",

      "summary": "Combustion-engined seven-seat SUV slots in between the Tiguan and Touareg\n\nFor as long as family SUVs occupy such prime commerical importance for European car-makers, few can afford to omit any from their showroom ranges, or to leave any market territory unplundered. Much as it's unlike the company, that's precisely what Volkswagen had been doing before the arrival of the Volkswagen Tayron: ignoring the untapped space between the popular five-seat Tiguan and the full-sized, premium-positioned Touareg.Wolfsburg had a preliminary tilt at addressing the problem with the Allspace version of the last-generation Tiguan of 2018, you may remember: which was a slightly stretched, seven-seat version of the smaller model. But now it has committed more fully to the idea of a proper, stand-alone, seven-seater rival for the likes of the Hyundai Santa Fe, Kia Sorento, Skoda Kodiaq and Peugeot 5008.Those of you who know your Chinese cars will be aware of the Tayron name from a crossover produced collaboratively by Volkswagen and FAW for the Chinese domestic market from 2018; but now the car's gone global. Production has moved to VW's Wolfsburg factory - itself the point of manufacture of nearly 50 million cars since 1938, and therefore a car factory of greater fecundity than any other in the world, by VW's own estimation - and the car's commercial potential has expanded significantly.Volkswagen Tayron range at a glanceThe Tayron offers one of the widest powertrain selections of the Volkswagen range, with petrols, diesels, mild hybrids and plug-in hybrids all on offer.The UK market gets the entry-level mild-hybrid 1.5 eTSI; both PHEVs; a 2.0-litre diesel; and two unhybridised 2.0-litre petrols, both of which come with 4Motion all-wheel drive.VersionPower1.5 eTSI148bhpeHybrid 204PS201bhpeHybrid 272PS268bhp2.0 TDI 150PS148bhp2.0 TSI 204PS 201bhp2.0 TSI 265PS262bhp",

      "title": "Used Cupra Formentor 2020-2024 review",
      "summary": "Volkswagen Group’s newest car brand stepped up with its first stand-alone model\n\nThe Cupra Formentor is both a brawny-looking crossover and a brilliant all-rounder with the taut handling of a well-sorted hatchback and the practicality of a crossover. The segment-blending family hauler - updated recently but we're focusing on the pre-facelift car here - had a stuttering start due to its arrival during the 2020 pandemic.But the Formentor has become Cupra's best-selling model, with so many finding homes that the used market now provides rich pickings, with prices starting from £13,000. There's an array of engines to consider: pick from a BIK-swerving plug-in hybrid or a pseudo-hot hatch with more than 300bhp. Or keep things simple by opting for the widely available 148bhp 1.5-litre or 187bhp 2.0-litre turbo petrols. The 1.5 TSI isn't the most exciting powerplant, but it will easily return 45mpg.If you want a bit more poke, the 2.0 TSI is a solid choice and it sends its power to both axles, which is good news for dynamics and all-weather traction. For spicing up the commute or school run in the snow, it's the better all-rounder.The 201bhp 1.4-litre plug-in hybrid isn't short on appeal, with 37 miles of claimed EV range still looking pretty competitive against newer rivals. Daily driving is a doddle on electric power, but even with a drained battery it should do 40-50mpg. They're easy to find and rather good value: you'll pay around £17k-£18k for a tidy PHEV with about 60,000 miles on the clock.The 1.5-litre cars cost about the same, but you'll have to dig deeper for a 2.0 TSI, which are priced from around £20,000. It's worth bearing in mind that all three powertrains are tied to entry- and mid-level V1 and V2 trims, but neither of these feels spartan.V1 cars get 18in wheels, LED headlights and a 10in infotainment screen, while V2s have heated seats, larger wheels and a rear-view camera.Inside, the Formentor offers good practicality. Despite the rakish roofline, there's enough head and leg room in the back for adults, although three on the rear bench can be a squeeze. You'll have no trouble carrying suitcases, buggies or pets in the 420-litre boot - although this drops to 345 litres on the plug-in hybrid because of the battery in the boot floor.Interior quality is strong with plush leather and copper trim upping the ambience. All versions get the same crisp 10.3in driver display, while the infotainment screen is a trim-dependent 10in or 12in. The central display is user-friendly and well configured, but the slider controls for volume and temperature aren't backlit and thus all but useless at night.VZI trim and above gets you the EA888 turbo four-pot that powers the Volkswagen Golf GTI and R. The 242bhp version has serious pace, but it's the 306bhp, four-wheel-drive model that cements the Formentor's high-riding hot hatch billing. It isn't quite as engaging as a fast Golf, but while many hot crossovers suffer for their jacked-up suspension and extra weight, the Formentor delivers just the right amount of grip, agility and body control to satisfy keen drivers.You'll need about £23k for a clean example with a reasonable mileage, and it's worth stumping up for VZ2 spec, which gets adaptive dampers. Then you'll have one of the best-riding, best-looking and best all-round crossovers, and all for less than the price of a new Golf.",

      "title": "On patrol with the police unit hunting drink- and drug-drivers",
      "summary": "Surrey Police are intent on stopping drink- and drug-driving. We join them on a patrol\n\nIt's 5pm on a weekday in Guildford, Surrey. For an hour, members of Surrey Police's Vanguard Road Safety team have been stopping motorists to warn them about the dangers of driving under the influence of drink and drugs, when they strike 'lucky' and nab a drug-driver. Clues?\nHis car reeks of cannabis and there's a box of the stuff on his dashboard. The driver's saliva is found to contain illegal levels of THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis, set at two micrograms per litre of blood. In light users, THC can remain in the blood for up to seven hours, but in heavier users it's at least 24 hours. Some users constantly microdose, so the drug never leaves their system.\nThe roadside test, which takes around eight minutes to process, can also detect cocaine (legal limit 10mg), but on this occasion there's no trace. The driver is told to get out of his car then is handcuffed and instructed to wait on the grass verge in view of passing motorists and a small crowd of onlookers.\nHe will be taken to a police station where his blood will be tested for other drugs including ecstasy, LSD, ketamine and heroin. The station test can detect drugs taken several days before, but the results take up to four months to come through. During this period, he may continue to drive but will have the uncertainty of the results hanging over him. If they're positive, a court file will be prepared and a date will be set for his trial. If found guilty of drug-driving, he will receive a minimum 12-month driving ban, an unlimited fine linked to his income and a criminal record.\n\nHis motor insurance will go through the roof. The same penalties apply to a driver found guilty of drink-driving.\nCoincidentally, as he is being tested at the roadside, so too is another driver - a young mother of two. She casually tells the police officer she smoked cannabis the previous day (when stopped, many users freely admit to the habit, suggesting they don't appreciate the consequences). The officer needs no further excuse to test, but the result is negative, and after receiving advice about the dangers of drink- and drug-driving she's sent on her way.\nThe officers conducting this 'meet 'n' greet' are part of Surrey Police's Vanguard Road Safety team. Formed in 2022 and almost unique among the UK's 45 police forces, the VRS team supports the Roads Policing Unit. But rather than reacting to incidents, it is proactive: its 12 officers, in a fleet of unmarked cars, seek out drivers committing the five fatal offences: not wearing a seatbelt, speeding, careless driving, distracted driving and drink- and drug-driving, the last the cause of 20% of fatal collisions.\n\"Our number one priority for road safety is to reduce the number of KSI [killed or seriously injured] collisions,\" explains Sergeant Dan Pascoe. \"Especially concerning drink- and drug-driving, we're often led by intel from sources including pub landlords, who see regulars drink-driving, from other police teams through their interactions with heavy drinkers and drug users in their home, and from neighbours and workmates. We use unmarked cars because parking a marked 5 Series outside a pub while waiting to catch someone doesn't really work. While moving locations, we look out for other offences. As we like to say, we can't be everywhere but could be anywhere.\"\n\nThe team also attends fatal offence hot spots such as major sports and music events, but a perennial fixture on their calendar is their participation in Operation Limit, a UK-wide, month-long, drink- and drug-driving crackdown that runs from 1 December to 1 January. Last year's operation generated nearly 60,000 drink and drug tests nationally, resulting in almost 7000 arrests, of which 3000 were for both drink- and drug-driving.\nDrink-driving alone accounted for around 10% of positive test results and drug-driving just over 40%. Reasons for the higher incidence of drug-driving, says Pascoe, include the very low legal limits, the fact that drugs stay in the system far longer than alcohol and, unlike drink-driving, the fact that the message that drug-driving is anti-social is simply not getting through.\n\"During Operation Limit, when we can focus more on drink-and drug-driving offences and when drivers are more likely to offend, we make three arrests each day,\" says Pascoe. \"Year-round, we arrest between four and 10 drink- and drug-drivers a week just through stopping them for their original offence of using a phone or not wearing a seatbelt. However, the most important part of Operation Limit and of our patrols during the rest of the year is stopping drivers to spread the message that drug- as well as drink-driving is not only anti-social but it kills, too.\"",
