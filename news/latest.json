Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone, Getty Images aracılığıyla Bardot, Jacques Charrier ve üç günlük oğulları Nicolas, 1960 yılında acımasızca hazcı bir seks sembolü olarak pazarlanan Bardot, ciddi bir oyuncu olma hırsından dolayı hayal kırıklığına uğradı.",
      "summary_tr_long": "French cinema actress Brigitte Bardot dies aged 91 Noor Nanji Culture correspondent Thomas Samson via Getty Images Brigitte Bardot - pictured here in 2006 - gave up acting to concentrate on animal welfare at the age of 39 French actress Brigitte Bardot, who revolutionised 1950s French cinema and became a symbol of sexual liberation, has died age 91. The cinema icon - BB as she was known in her home country - acted in almost 50 films, including And God Created Woman, but retired in 1973 to devote her life to animal welfare. French President Emmanuel Macron said the nation was mourning \"a legend of the century\", while the Brigitte Bardot Foundation remembered her as a \"world-renowned actress\". Later in life, Bardot's reputation was damaged after she made homophobic slurs and was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred. The Brigitte Bardot Foundation said she was \"a world-renowned actress and singer, who chose to abandon her prestigious career to dedicate her life and energy to animal welfare and her foundation.\" It did not specify where or when Bardot died. Paying tribute, Macron wrote: \"Her films, her voice, her dazzling glory, her initials, her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, her face that became Marianne, Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom. We mourn a legend of the century.\" Meanwhile, French far-right politician Marine Le Pen said France had lost \"an exceptional woman, through her talent, her courage, her frankness, her beauty\". Bardot's husband, whom she married in 1992, was Bernard d'Ormale, a former adviser to the late far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen - the father of Marine. Herbert Dorfman/Corbis via Getty Images Bardot tore up the rule book of French cinema in the 1950s Brigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born in Paris in 1934 to a wealthy family, who wanted her to become a ballerina. She was discovered in her teens after posing on the cover of Elle magazine, swiftly becoming a sensation in her home country, and was persuaded to enter the cinema world. She played iconic roles, the most notable in the 1956 film And God Created Woman, directed by her then-husband Roger Vadim, in which she played a sexually liberated woman. The film scandalised the American public and was banned in some US states, while the French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir hailed her as an icon of \"absolute freedom\". Through the late 1950s and 1960s, she became a global phenomenon with roles in The Truth, earning critical acclaim for her dramatic depth; Contempt, a Jean-Luc Godard masterpiece; and Viva Maria!, showcasing her comedic flair alongside Jeanne Moreau. Beyond her most iconic roles, Bardot showcased her versatility in films like Love on a Pillow, where she portrayed a complex, emotionally-torn character, and Two Weeks in September, a romantic drama that highlighted her ability to convey vulnerability. As well as her work in film, Bardot will also be remembered as a fashion icon, with her blonde tousled hair and bold eyeliner setting beauty trends worldwide. After wearing an off-the-shoulder number in Cannes in 1953, similar styles became known as the Bardot neckline. Nicolas later sued his mother for emotional damage after she wrote in an autobiography that she would have preferred to \"give birth to a little dog\". Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images Bardot, Jacques Charrier and their three-day-old son Nicolas in 1960 Ruthlessly marketed as a hedonistic sex symbol, Bardot was frustrated in her ambition to become a serious actress. At the height of her fame, she announced she was retiring at the age of 39 to devote her life to animal welfare. In 1986, she launched the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, which works to protect wild and domestic animals. She became a vegetarian, and in 2013 even threatened to apply for Russian citizenship in protest against plans to kill two sick elephants in a French zoo. Reacting to her death, France's oldest animal protection association - The Société Protectrice des Animaux - paid tribute to an \"iconic and passionate figure for the animal cause\". Charly Hel/Prestige/Getty Images Bardot, pictured here in 2001, became an increasingly controversial figure in her later life But for all her cinema successes and animal welfare work, Bardot leaves behind a controversial legacy, with a string of remarks later in life about Islam, gay people and the #MeToo movement impacting her reputation. From the late 1990s, Bardot was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred after comments she made online and in interviews about Muslims. She was fined €15,000 (£12,000) in 2008 after complaining on her website that Muslims were \"destroying our country by imposing their ways\". Bardot faced fierce criticism for her 2003 book, A Cry in the Silence, where she argued gay people, modern art, politicians and immigrants destroyed French culture. In 2018, Bardot also dismissed actresses who commented on sexual harassment via the #MeToo movement as \"hypocritical, ridiculous, uninteresting\". \"There are many actresses who flirt with producers in order to get a role,\" Bardot said in an interview with French magazine, Paris Match.",

Lido/Shutterstock Bardot helped to make the bikini socially acceptable in the 1950s Brigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born in Paris on 28 September 1934. Roger Viollet via Getty Images Her parents wanted Brigitte Bardot to become a ballet dancer With German troops occupying Paris during World War II, Bardot spent most of her time at home, dancing to records. By the age of 15, she later recalled, \"I was seeking something, perhaps a fulfilment of myself.\" A family friend persuaded her to pose for the cover of Elle, the leading women's magazine in France, and the photographs caused a sensation. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images Brigitte Bardot's early magazine covers redefined fashion and the concept of beauty At the time, fashionable women had short hair, carefully matched their accessories, and sported tailored jackets and silky evening wear. At the age of 16, she found herself the most famous cover girl in Paris. QUINIO/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images Bardot was infatuated with aspiring director Roger Vadim The screen tests were not successful, but Vadim - who was six years older - took her on, first as his protégé and then as his fiancée. Pathe Cinema/Getty Images Roger Vadim helped his teenage wife launch her film career Roger Vadim, her 'wild wolf' In retaliation, she attempted to take her own life, but was discovered and stopped just in time. Hulton Archive/Getty Images Bardot and Vadim on their wedding day at the Church of Passy, Paris, 12 December 1952. Vadim sold the pictures of the ceremony to Paris-Match Under such pressure, her parents relented, but forbade the couple from marrying until Brigitte was 18. But, until 1956, she was chiefly famous for posing in bikinis - until then a garment banned in Spain, Italy and much of America for being on the razor edge of decency - and popularising a beehive hairdo. Atlantis Films/Pictorial Parade/Courtesy of Getty Images Existentialist philosophers hailed Bardot as an icon of \"absolute freedom\" She divorced Vadim, who reacted as only a Frenchman could. \"I prefer to have that kind of wife,\" he said, \"knowing she is unfaithful, rather than possess a woman who just loved me and no-one else.\" He went on to work with Bardot again, and later live with Catherine Deneuve and marry Jane Fonda. A reluctant mother In 1959, Brigitte - after several love affairs - married the actor Jacques Charrier, with whom she starred in Babette Goes To War. The couple had a son, Nicolas, but Bardot resented her pregnancy: repeatedly punching herself in the stomach and begging a doctor for morphine to induce a miscarriage. AFP via Getty Images Bardot resented her pregnancy and was later sued by her son for emotional damage After the inevitable divorce, Nicolas did not see his mother for decades. \"I have not had very much chance to act,\" she complained, \"mostly I have had to undress.\" She began to attract the attention of Europe's most respected film-makers, winning critical acclaim in Jean-Luc Godard's powerful, New Wave drama, Le Mépris (Contempt). \"I have not had very much chance to act,\" she complained, \"mostly I have had to undress.\" She made dozens of records, alongside Serge Gainsbourg and Sacha Distel. It became a huge hit all over Europe, with Bardot's version remaining under wraps for 20 years. Animal rights campaigner After nearly 50 films, she announced she was retiring to devote her life to animal welfare in 1973. Philippe Caron/Sygma/Getty Images She raised 3m francs (then about £300,000) to establish the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, by auctioning off her jewellery and film memorabilia. She became a vegetarian, attacked the Chinese government for \"torturing\" bears, and spent hundreds of thousands on a programme to sterilise Romanian stray dogs. Sygma via Getty Images Bardot campaigned against the culling of seals and the fur trade, among other issues A troubled end to a troubled life In her later years, she was prosecuted on multiple occasions for racial hatred. In 1999, she wrote that \"my homeland is invaded by an overpopulation of foreigners, especially Muslims\". She went on to criticise interracial marriages and insult gay men who, in her words, \"jiggle their bottoms, put their little fingers in the air, and with their little castrato voices moan about what those ghastly heteros put them through\". Bardot was in court so often that, in 2008, the prosecutor declared that he was \"weary\" of charging her. Gilles BASSIGNAC/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images Bardot was in court so often that the prosecutor said he was \"weary\" of charging her In the 1960s, Brigitte Bardot was chosen as the official face of Marianne, the emblem of French liberty.

Askeri hükümet, darbeyle iktidarı ele geçirmesinden yaklaşık beş yıl sonra aşamalı bir oylama düzenliyor, bu da geniş çaplı bir muhalefete yol açıyor ve iç savaşa dönüşüyor. Gözlemciler cuntanın, Çin'in desteğiyle, bu yıkıcı çıkmazdan çıkış yolu ararken gücünü meşrulaştırmaya çalıştığını söylüyor. Ölüm cezası da dahil olmak üzere ağır cezalar öngören yeni yasa kapsamında 200'den fazla kişi, seçimleri bozmak veya seçimlere karşı çıkmakla suçlanıyor. Pazar günü ilk tur oylama yapılırken birçok bölgede patlama ve hava saldırıları olduğu bildirildi. Bölge başbakanı BBC'ye yaptığı açıklamada, Mandalay bölgesinde sabahın erken saatlerinde ıssız bir eve düzenlenen roket saldırısında üç kişinin yaralandığını söyledi. Ayrı bir gelişmede, Cumartesi günü geç saatlerde Tayland sınırı yakınındaki Myawaddy ilçesinde meydana gelen bir dizi patlamada ondan fazla ev hasar gördü.

BM Özel Raportörü Tom Andrews, Pazar günü uluslararası topluma, bundan \"meşru hiçbir şey çıkamayacağını\" söyleyerek çağrıda bulundu: \"Sivilleri bombalamaya, siyasi liderleri hapse atmaya ve her türlü muhalefeti suç saymaya devam eden bir seçim, bir seçim değil, silah zoruyla yapılan bir saçmalık tiyatrosudur\" dedi. Hem darbeye karşı çıkan silahlı direniş gruplarına hem de kendi milislerine sahip etnik ordulara karşı birçok cephede savaşıyor. Bir dizi büyük aksilik sonucu ülkenin büyük bir bölümünün kontrolünü kaybetti, ancak bu yıl Çin ve Rusya'nın desteğiyle gerçekleştirilen amansız hava saldırılarının ardından bölgeyi geri aldı. Seçim yapılması için büyük bir lojistik zorluk var. Ülkedeki 330 ilçenin 265'inde oylamanın üç aşamada yapılması planlanıyor, geri kalanının ise çok istikrarsız olduğu düşünülüyor.

İkili, Moskova'nın henüz desteklemediği ABD aracılı barış planının güncellenmiş versiyonunun yanı sıra ABD güvenlik garantilerine ilişkin ayrı önerileri de tartışacak. ABD Başkanı'nın Mar-a-Lago'daki evinde gerçekleşen toplantı, Rusya'nın hafta sonu Kiev'e yönelik yoğun bombardımanının ardından gerçekleşti.

Trump röportajda \"Vladimir Putin ile işler iyi gidecek sanırım\" dedi ve Rusya Devlet Başkanı ile \"yakında\" görüşmeyi beklediğini ekledi. Kanada Başbakanı Mark Carney ile yaptığı görüşmelerin ardından Zelensky, Moskova'nın Kiev'e yönelik son saldırısının \"Rusya'nın barış çabalarımıza cevabı olduğunu ve bu gerçekten Putin'in barış istemediğini gösteriyor\" dedi. Zelensky ayrıca Trump ile görüşmesi öncesinde Avrupalı liderlerle diplomatik \"öncelikleri\" görüşmek üzere bir çağrıda bulundu. Almanya Şansölyesi Friedrich Merz, planın ilerlemesi için \"güçlü pozisyonlara ihtiyaç duyulduğunu\" söyledi. Kiev'de Cuma gecesi ile Cumartesi sabahı arasında duyulan silah sesleri ve patlamalar, Rusya'nın hafta sonu Ukrayna'ya saldırılar düzenlediğini ve bunların en yıkıcısının Kiev'i hedef aldığını söyledi. Rusya savunma bakanlığı, \"Ukrayna Silahlı Kuvvetleri ve Ukrayna askeri-endüstriyel kompleksindeki işletmelerin çıkarları için\" kullanıldığını iddia ettiği enerji tesislerini hedef almak için uzun menzilli hassas silahların kullanıldığını söyledi. Ukraynalı yetkililere göre Rusya, enerji ve sivil altyapıyı hedef alarak Kiev'e yaklaşık 500 drone ve 40 füze yöneltti. Saldırıların ardından fotoğraflarda, BBC muhabiri Anastasiya Gribanova'nın apartman bloğunun vurulduğu görüldü. O sırada binanın asansöründe bulunan Gribanova saldırıdan yara almadan kurtulurken, Batı Ukrayna ile 530 kilometrelik (320 mil) bir sınıra sahip olan Polonya, savaş uçaklarını, karadaki hava savunma sistemlerini ve radar keşiflerini hazır hale getirdi. Ukrayna Silahlı Kuvvetleri Genelkurmay Başkanlığı, cumartesi gecesi ile pazar günü arasında Ukrayna'ya daha az sayıda füzenin ateşlendiğini, ordunun ülkenin kuzeyinde, güneyinde ve doğusunda 30 insansız hava aracını püskürttüğünü söyledi.",

İran'ın son Şahı'nın sürgündeki oğlu Prens Rıza Pehlevi, onun vefatını \"ülkemizin sanatı ve kültürü açısından büyük bir kayıp\" olarak nitelendirdi.

Beyzai, hem oyun yazarı hem de film yönetmeni olarak çalışmalarında doğrudan siyasi göndermelerden kaçındı ve her zaman açık mesajlar vermemeye çalıştığını söyledi. Ancak onlarca yıldır yaptığı çalışmalar, tarihi, hatta efsanevi figürleri baskıcı dini ve siyasi sistemlerle çatışmaya sokuyor. Ünlü şairlerden oluşan bir aileden gelen Beyzai, doğuştan itibaren İran kültürünün en derin geleneklerine sahipti.

O dönemde yaptığı diğer filmler gibi bu film de İran'da yasaklandı, ancak daha sonra film eleştirmenleri tarafından tüm zamanların en iyi İran filmi olarak oylandı. Bu yılki Venedik Film Festivali'nde restore edilmiş versiyonuyla gösterilen film, klasikler bölümünde en iyi film ödülünü kazandı. Beyzai nihayet 2010 yılında İran'dan ayrıldı ve sonraki yıllarını ABD'de İran kültürünü öğreterek geçirdi.

Avustralya Deniz Güvenliği Otoritesi (Amsa) sözcüsü BBC'ye yaptığı açıklamada Coral Adventurer'dan bir imdat çağrısı almadığını söyledi. Durumu izlediğini ve gerekirse PNG yetkililerini destekleyeceğini de sözlerine ekledi. 30 Aralık'ta bitmesi planlanan 12 günlük yolculukla ilgili herhangi bir karar alınmadı. Olay sırasında gemide 80 yolcu ve 43 mürettebat bulunuyordu. Mercan Maceracısı şu anda Amsa ve Queensland Polisi tarafından ortak bir soruşturmaya tabi tutuluyor; Bayan Rees, 26 Ekim'de Kertenkele Adası'nda ölü bulundu. Yolcu arkadaşlarıyla birlikte adada yürüyüş yapıyordu ancak dinlenmek için gruptan ayrıldı. Gemi onu almadan yola çıktı ve mürettebat kadının kaybolduğunu fark ettikten birkaç saat sonra geri döndü. Ertesi gün büyük bir arama operasyonu cesedini buldu. Bayan Rees öldüğünde gemi 60 günlük yolculuğuna sadece iki gün kalmıştı. Yolculuğun geri kalanı, tüm yolculara tam para iadesi teklif edilerek iptal edildi. Coral Expeditions'ın CEO'su Mark Fifield, şirketin \"bunun gerçekleşmesinden dolayı çok üzgün olduğunu\" ve Rees ailesine tam destek sunduğunu söyledi. Bay Fifield, kruvaziyer operatörünün \"soruşturmalarını desteklemek için Queensland Polisi ve diğer yetkililerle yakın işbirliği içinde çalıştığını\" ekledi. Amsa soruşturmanın durumu hakkında yorum yapamadı ve BBC'ye \"soruşturma sonuçlarını kamuya açıklama pratiğinde olmadığını\" söyledi.",

Elías Padilla, bir yıldan fazla bir süredir belgesiz bir göçmen olarak Honduras'tan Amerika Birleşik Devletleri'ne yolculuk yapmak için para biriktiriyordu. Kötü günlerde 12 saatte 12$ (9£) gibi az bir para kazanıyor. ABD'nin büyük şehirlerindeki belgesiz göçmenlerin Göçmenlik ve Gümrük Muhafaza (ICE) görevlileri tarafından bilekleri fermuarlı halde sürüklendiği görüntüler, Orta Amerika'daki en az bir göçmen adayını kuzeye seyahat etmekten caydırdı. \"Örneğin şu iş kolunu ele alalım: ABD'deki bir Uber sürücüsü benim bir günde yaptığım işi bir saatte yapıyor.\" Çoğu Honduraslı göçmen gibi Elías da ABD'ye ulaşmanın asıl amacının eve para göndermek olduğunu söylüyor. \"Umarım işler düzelir.\" Getty Images Başkan Trump, yasadışı göçe karşı büyük bir baskı emri verdi Elías'ın fikrini değiştirmesi, aralarında sınır çarı Tom Homan ve iç güvenlik danışmanı Stephen Miller'ın da bulunduğu Başkan Donald Trump'ın göç politikalarının mimarları için şüphesiz hoş bir haber olacaktır. Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte ve Minneapolis'teki tartışmalı ICE operasyonları, belgesiz göçmenleri ABD topraklarından çıkarmanın yanı sıra, her zaman Elías gibi insanları Honduras'tan ayrılmaya çalışmaktan bile caydırmayı da amaçlıyordu. Ancak bu politikalar Honduras ekonomisine beklenmedik bir kazanç getirdi: Bu şehirlerde belgesiz ve gözlerden uzak yaşayan binlerce Honduraslı, evlerine her zamankinden daha fazla para gönderiyor. Pek çok belgesiz Honduraslı, gelecekleri konusunda yaklaşmakta olan bir tehdit veya son tarih hissini paylaşırken, çoğu fazla geç olmadan her doları ailelerine geri göndermeye çalışıyor. Bu yılın Ocak ve Ekim ayları arasında Honduras'a yapılan havalelerde geçen yılın aynı dönemine göre %26 artış yaşandı. Aslında, ABD'de sayıları azalsa da Honduraslılar ülkelerine gönderilen miktarı 2024'ün tamamında 9,7 milyar dolardan (7,2 milyar £) bu yılın sadece ilk dokuz ayında 10,1 milyar doların (7,5 milyar £) üzerine çıkardı. BBC, beş yıldır yaşadığı ve inşaatta çalıştığı ABD'nin büyük bir şehrinden Marcos (gerçek adı değil) ile telefonda konuştu. Ama aynı zamanda, sonunda bir ev inşa edebileceğimiz, belki de bir araba alabileceğimiz küçük bir arazi satın almak için bir kenara bir şeyler koyabilirler\" diyor. Başkan Trump göreve geldiğinden beri Marcos, ABD'de kira ve yiyecek için yalnızca ihtiyaç duyduğu minimum tutarı tuttuğunu söylüyor. ABD'deki Getty Images Honduraslılar evlerine her zamankinden daha fazla para gönderiyor Honduras'ın başkenti Tegucigalpa'daki karısına ve iki çocuğuna gönderdiği miktarı istikrarlı bir şekilde \"ayda 500 dolardan daha fazlasına\" yükseltti Haftada 300 dolar\" diyor. Marcos, ICE'nin tutuklama ağına yakalanmadan mümkün olduğunca çok kişiyi eve göndermek için \"zamana karşı bir yarış gibi\" diye açıklıyor. Şimdi, Trump ve ICE ile ilgili her şey olup biterken ve sokaklarda bu kadar çok korku varken, eğer yakalanırsam orada bir kenara biraz para ayrılacağından emin olmak istiyorum.\" Kısmen, kendisinin iki ay boyunca bir gözaltı merkezinde kalması durumunda ailesinin ona güvenemeyeceğini bilerek tutuklanma ihtimaline hazırlanmaya çalıştığını da ekliyor. Meksika'daki Getty Images Kartelleri öncelikle göçmenleri Orta Amerika'dan ABD'ye götüren rotayı kontrol ediyor. Jimmy (gerçek adı değil) eski bir çakal ya da insan kaçakçısı olup başkentin dışında bir yerde BBC ile konuşmayı kabul etmişti. 20 yıl boyunca, genellikle yolculuğun en tehlikeli ayağı olarak kabul edilen Meksika'yı geçerek geçimini sağladı. Bu, öncelikle Meksikalı organize suç grupları tarafından yönetilen yasa dışı bir endüstridir ve Jimmy, büyük kartellerden herhangi biri için özel olarak çalışmadığını iddia etse de, onların bilgisi ve onların onayıyla faaliyet gösterdiğini kabul etmektedir. Bugün, potansiyel müşterilerin \"fiyatın iki katına çıktığını, kişi başı 12.000-13.000 $'dan 25.000-30.000 $'a çıktığını\" gördüklerini söylüyor. \"CBP One uygulaması (Biden döneminde sığınma talebinde bulunmak için kullanılan yasal bir yol) kapsamında çok daha fazlası vardı ama belki %40'ı hâlâ bu noktaya ulaşıyor.\" İnsan kaçakçılığının yüksek maliyetlerini \"herkes ödeyemeyeceği\" için daha az insanın ayrıldığını ekliyor. Parayı toplamak için çok çalışmış ve kişisel eşyalarını satmış olan Elías, ABD'ye geldikten hemen sonra sınır dışı edilme riskini göze alamaz. ABD'ye başarılı bir şekilde yerleşme şansının Donald Trump döneminde azaldığını bilmesine rağmen Elías, ya mevcut ICE baskınları dalgasının ya da Trump başkanlığının tamamının geçmesini beklemekten başka seçeneği olmadığını söylüyor. Orta Amerikalı göçmenlerin yıllar boyunca kendilerine karşı hem bölgesel hükümetler hem de Washington tarafından her türlü sert politikaya maruz kaldıklarını ekliyor.",

Hızlı vize süreçleri artık bu ülkeden gelen kişiler için geçerli olmayacak, İçişleri Bakanlığı ise VIP'lerin ve politikacıların artık Birleşik Krallık'a gelirken ayrıcalıklı muamele görmeyeceğini söyledi. Bu arada İçişleri Bakanlığı, Kongo Demokratik Cumhuriyeti'nin yanı sıra yaptırımlarla tehdit edilen Angola ve Namibya'nın vatandaşlarını geri alma çabalarını artırma konusunda anlaştıklarını söyledi. Bir hükümet kaynağı, İçişleri Bakanı Shabana Mahmood'un vatandaşlarını geri almayı reddeden diğer ülkelere vizeyi yasaklamakta tereddüt etmeyeceğini söyledi. İçişleri Bakanlığı, Angola ve Namibya'nın süreçlerini iyileştirme konusunda anlaşmaya varmasının \"geçen ayki sığınma reformlarından elde edilen ilk teslimat başarısı\" olduğunu söyledi. Hükümet, Angola, Namibya ve Demokratik Kongo Cumhuriyeti'nden gelen kişilere, geri gönderme konusunda işbirliğini hızlı bir şekilde geliştirmemesi halinde bu kişilere vize vermeyi durduracağı konusunda uyarmıştı. İçişleri Bakanlığı'ndan bir kaynak, anlaşmalar sonucunda binlerce kişinin uzaklaştırılıp sınır dışı edilebileceğini söyledi. Hükümetin Birleşik Krallık'ın iltica sisteminde yaptığı değişiklikler uyarınca, mülteci statüsü geçici hale gelecek, sığınmacılara yönelik garantili barınma desteği sona erecek ve Birleşik Krallık'a yeni sınırlı \"güvenli ve yasal yollar\" oluşturulacak. Geçen ay değişiklikleri açıklayan Mahmood, geri dönüş politikalarıyla işbirliği yapmayan ülkelere, Birleşik Krallık'taki vatandaşlarını yasadışı bir şekilde geri alana kadar yüksek sığınma talepleri olan ülkeler için vizelere \"acil durum freni\" de dahil olmak üzere vize cezalarının uygulanacağı konusunda uyarmıştı. İçişleri Bakanlığı, Demokratik Kongo Cumhuriyeti, Angola ve Namibya'dan gelen dönüşlerin, evrak işlerinin işleme alınmaması veya kişilerin kendi belgelerini imzalamalarının zorunlu olması nedeniyle hüsrana uğradığını ve onlara etkili bir veto hakkı tanıdığını söylemişti.

      "summary_tr_long": "Tayland ile Kamboçya arasında, neredeyse üç haftadır süren ölümcül çatışmaların yaklaşık bir milyon insanı evlerinden etmek zorunda bıraktığı sınır boyunca ateşkes yürürlüğe girdi. İki ülkenin savunma bakanları yaptıkları ortak açıklamada, ön hatların şu anda bulundukları yerde dondurulması, takviye kuvvetlerin yasaklanması ve sınır bölgelerinde yaşayan sivillerin mümkün olan en kısa sürede geri dönmesine izin verilmesi konusunda mutabakata vardı. Ateşkes Cumartesi günü yerel saatle öğle saatlerinde (05:00 GMT) yürürlüğe girdi. Açıklamada, Tayland'ın temmuz ayından bu yana alıkoyduğu 18 Kamboçyalı askerin 72 saat süreyle görevde kalmasının ardından serbest bırakılacağı belirtildi. Bu atılım, iki ülke arasında Çin ve ABD'nin diplomatik teşvikiyle günlerce süren görüşmelerin ardından geldi. Anlaşma, yerinden edilenlerin evlerine geri gönderilmesine öncelik veriyor ve aynı zamanda mayınların kaldırılmasına ilişkin bir anlaşmayı da içeriyor. Tayland Savunma Bakanı Natthaphon Narkphanit ateşkesi \"karşı tarafın samimiyeti\" için bir test olarak nitelendirdi. Gazetecilere verdiği demeçte, \"Ateşkesin gerçekleşmemesi veya ihlal edilmesi durumunda Tayland, uluslararası hukuk uyarınca meşru müdafaa hakkını saklı tutacaktır.\" BM insan hakları sorumlusu Volker Türk, ateşkesin \"barışa giden yolu açacağını\" umduğunu söylerken, bir AB sözcüsü ateşkesin uygulanmasında \"iyi niyet\" çağrısında bulundu. Tayland, sonuncusunun gerektiği gibi uygulanmadığını söyleyerek ateşkesi kabul etmekte isteksiz davranmıştı. Ayrıca Kamboçya'nın çatışmayı uluslararasılaştırma çabaları olarak gördükleri şeye de kızdılar. Temmuz ayındaki son ateşkesten farklı olarak, ABD Dışişleri Bakanlığı dahil olmasına rağmen ABD Başkanı Donald Trump bariz bir şekilde bu ateşkeste yoktu. Bu ateşkes anlaşması, bu ayın başlarında yeni çatışmaların patlak vermesiyle çöktü. Her iki taraf da ateşkesin bozulmasından birbirini sorumlu tuttu. Tayland ordusu, askerlerinin Tayland'ın Si Sa Ket eyaletindeki Kamboçya ateşine karşılık verdiğini ve iki Taylandlı askerin yaralandığını söyledi. Kamboçya savunma bakanlığı, Preah Vihear eyaletine ilk saldıranın Tayland güçleri olduğunu söyledi ve Kamboçya'nın misilleme yapmaması konusunda ısrar etti. Cuma günü Tayland, Kamboçya'ya daha fazla hava saldırısı düzenledi. Tayland Hava Kuvvetleri, sivillerin bölgeyi terk etmesinden sonra Kamboçya'nın \"müstahkem askeri mevzisini\" vurduğunu söyledi. Kamboçya savunma bakanlığı, saldırıların sivil evlere yönelik \"ayrım gözetmeyen saldırılar\" olduğunu söyledi. Ateşkesin bu kez ne kadar başarılı olacağı büyük ölçüde siyasi iradeye bağlı. Her iki ülkede de milliyetçi duygular alevlendi. Özellikle Kamboçya çok sayıda askerini ve askeri teçhizatını kaybetti. Sınırda tuttuğu mevzilerden geri püskürtüldü ve Tayland'ın hava saldırılarından büyük zarar gördü; bu şikayetler, kalıcı bir barışın sağlanmasını zorlaştırabilir. Sınır konusundaki anlaşmazlık bir asırdan daha eskiye dayanıyor ancak bu yılın başında bir grup Kamboçyalı kadının tartışmalı bir tapınakta vatansever şarkılar söylemesiyle gerilim arttı. Mayıs ayındaki çatışmada bir Kamboçyalı asker öldürüldü ve iki ay sonra Temmuz ayında sınır boyunca beş gün süren yoğun çatışmalarda düzinelerce asker ve sivil hayatını kaybetti. Malezya ve Başkan Trump'ın müdahalesinin ardından iki ülke arasında hassas bir ateşkes müzakere edildi ve Ekim ayı sonlarında imzalandı. Trump anlaşmayı \"Kuala Lumpur Barış Anlaşmaları\" olarak adlandırdı. Her iki tarafa da ağır silahlarını ihtilaflı bölgeden çekmeleri ve bölgeyi gözlemleyecek geçici bir gözlemci ekibi kurmaları talimatı verildi. Ancak anlaşma, Taylandlı askerlerin kara mayınları nedeniyle yaralanması ve Tayland Başbakanı Anutin Charnvirakul'un güvenlik tehdidinin \"aslında azalmadığını\" açıklamasının ardından Kasım ayında Tayland tarafından askıya alınmıştı.",

Trump told Politico he ordered the 25 December strikes as \"a Christmas present\" - contradicting a statement by Nigerian officials. Camps run by the group in Sokoto state were hit near the border with Niger, the US military said. Casualty numbers are unclear, but both US and Nigerian officials say militants were killed. Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar told the BBC it was a \"joint operation\" and had \"nothing to do with a particular religion\". Tuggar said the strikes had been planned \"for quite some time\" using intelligence provided by Nigeria. Referring to the timing of strikes - which took place late on Thursday - he said they did not have \"anything to do with Christmas\". But Trump told Politico otherwise in an interview. \"They were going to do it earlier,\" Trump said of the airstrikes. \"And I said, 'nope, let's give a Christmas present.' \"They didn't think that was coming, but we hit them hard. Every camp got decimated.\" The US military said an \"initial assessment\" suggested \"multiple\" fatalities in Sokoto state. A local official in the Tangaza area of Sokoto state, Isa Salihu Bashir, told the BBC the strikes had \"hit some Lakurawa terrorist camps\". He said many fighters had been killed but the death toll was unclear. The BBC has been unable to independently confirm casualty figures. Bashir added that border patrols on the Niger side reported seeing Lakurawa fighters fleeing the targeted areas. The Nigerian government has long been fighting an array of jihadist groups, including Boko Haram and IS-linked factions, but largely in the north-east. But in recent years a smaller group - known locally as Lakurawa - has sought to establish a base in north-western Sokoto state. Nigerian authorities say the group has links to jihadist networks in Mali and Niger. They add that its members have settled in border communities, recruited young people, and imposed harsh controls. Tangaza is made up of remote villages, whose residents are mostly moderate Muslims. In a statement late on Friday, Nigeria's information ministry said \"precision strike operations\" had been carried with the \"explicit approval\" of President Bola Tinubu and with \"the full involvement of the armed forces of Nigeria\". It also said that during the operation debris from munitions fell in two communities – the village of Jabo, also in Sokoto state, and Offa in Kwara state, about 600km (370 miles) to the south. No civilian casualties were reported in either location. Umar Jabo, an eyewitness in Jabo, told the BBC: \"Something that looked like a plane flashed and crashed... in fields.\" He said there was no issue with IS in the area: \"We live peacefully, and there is no conflict between us and Christians.\" The Trump administration has previously accused the Nigerian government of failing to protect Christians from jihadist attacks and has claimed a \"genocide\" is being perpetrated. Trump has labelled Nigeria a \"country of particular concern\", a designation used by the US state department that provides for sanctions against countries \"engaged in severe violations of religious freedom\". The US military was ordered to prepare to intervene in Nigeria in November . US Department of Defense The US defence department posted a short video that appears to show a missile being launched from a military vessel In a social media post late on Christmas Day confirming the strikes, Trump said that he would \"not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper\". US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Thursday that he was \"grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation\". The Pentagon later posted a short video that appeared to show a missile being launched from a ship. Militants allied to IS have sought to establish a presence in two north-western states, while a separate IS-linked group has a stronghold in north-eastern Borno Nigeria is Africa's most populous country, with about 220 million people, divided roughly evenly between Christians and Muslims. Jihadist groups such as Boko Haram and IS-linked offshoots have wrought havoc in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade, killing thousands of people. Most victims have been Muslims, according to Acled, a group that analyses political violence around the world. The strikes are the second major US intervention targeting IS in recent weeks. Last week, the US said it had carried out a \"massive strike\" against IS in Syria . US Central Command (Centcom) said fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery had struck more than 70 targets. Those strikes were launched in retaliation for the killing of three Americans - two soldiers and a civilian interpreter - in an ambush.",

But in the 25 years Vladimir Putin has been in power, Russia's rich and powerful - known as oligarchs - have lost almost all their political influence. Western sanctions have failed to turn the uber-rich into his opponents, and his carrot-and-stick policies have turned them into silent backers. I couldn't negotiate.\" Within a week, a company linked to Vladimir Potanin - currently Russia's fifth-richest businessman, who supplies nickel for fighter jet engines - announced that it was buying the bank. It was sold for only 3% of its true value, says Tinkov. In the end, Tinkov lost almost $9bn (£6.5bn) of the fortune he once had, and left Russia. Chris Graythen/Getty Images Oleg Tinkov lost billions and left Russia after criticising the war against Ukraine This is a far cry from the way things were before Putin became president. In the years following the break-up of the Soviet Union, some Russians became fabulously rich by taking ownership of massive enterprises formerly owned by the state, and by exploiting the opportunities of their country's nascent capitalism. Their newly acquired wealth brought them influence and power during a period of political turmoil and they became known as oligarchs. Russia's most powerful oligarch, Boris Berezovsky, claimed to have orchestrated Putin's ascent to presidency in 2000, and years later he appealed for forgiveness for doing so: \"I didn't see the future greedy tyrant and usurper in him, the man who would trample freedom and stop Russia's development,\" he wrote in 2012. Berezovsky may have exaggerated his role, but Russia's oligarchs were certainly capable of pulling strings at the highest echelons of power. A little more than a year after his apology, Berezovsky was found dead in mysterious circumstances in exile in the UK. Hulton Archive/Getty Images Boris Berezovsky went into exile in the UK where he later died in mysterious circumstances in 2013 So when Putin gathered Russia's richest in the Kremlin hours after ordering the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, there was little they could do to object, even though they knew their fortunes were about to take a massive hit. According to Forbes magazine, in the year to April 2022, their number fell from 117 to 83 because of the war, sanctions and a weakened rouble. Collectively, they lost $263bn - or 27% of their wealth each on average. Lavish spending on the war spurred economic growth of more than 4% a year in Russia in 2023 and 2024. In 2024, more than half of Russia's billionaires either played some role in supplying the military or benefited from the invasion, says Giacomo Tognini, from Forbes's Wealth team. And I think it's fair to say that anyone running a business in Russia needs to have a relationship with the government,\" he told the BBC. This year saw the highest ever number of billionaires in Russia - 140 - on the Forbes list. Their collective worth ($580bn) was just $3bn shy of the all-time high registered in the year before the invasion. Once Russia's richest man, he spent 10 years in jail after launching a pro-democracy organisation in 2001. AFP Mikhail Khodorkovsky was Russia's richest man but he was sent to jail and his oil company Yukos was nationalised Since the invasion, almost all of Russia's mega-rich have stayed quiet, and those few who have publicly opposed it have had to abandon their country and much of their wealth. Russia's wealthiest are clearly key to Putin's war effort, and many of them, including the 37 business people summoned to the Kremlin on 24 February 2022, have been targeted by Western sanctions. But if the West wanted to make them poorer and turn against the Kremlin, it has failed, given the continuing wealth and absence of dissent among Russian billionaires. \"The West did everything possible to ensure that Russian billionaires rallied around the flag,\" says Alexander Kolyandr of the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA). All that effectively helped Putin to mobilise the billionaires, their assets and their money, and use it to support the Russian war economy,\" he tells the BBC. The exodus of foreign companies in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine created a vacuum quickly filled by Kremlin-friendly business people who were allowed to buy up highly lucrative assets on the cheap. \"Their future wellbeing depends on continued confrontation between Russia and the West,\" while their worst fear is the return of the previous owner, she says. In 2024 alone, 11 new billionaires emerged in Russia in this way, according to Giacomo Tognini. Russia's leader has maintained a firm grip on the country's key movers and shakers, despite the war and Western sanctions - and in some respects because of them.",

      "summary_tr_long": "How frogs went from right-wing meme to anti-ICE protest symbol Getty Images Immigration agents in Portland spraying crowd control chemicals into a protester's frog costume went viral in October The revolution will not be televised, but it might have webbed feet and bulging eyes. As protests against the Trump administration continue in US cities, demonstrators are adopting the energy of a community costume parade or block party. \"There's a lot going on with that little inflatable frog,\" says LM Bogad, a professor at University of California, Davis and a Guggenheim Fellow who specialises in performance art. From Pepe to Portland It's hard to talk about protests and frogs without talking about Pepe, a cartoon character embraced by far-right groups during Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Pepe was also depicted in right-wing online communities on 4chan, 8chan, and Reddit in darker contexts, as Adolf Hitler or a member of the violent white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan. Getty Images A man seen wearing a Pepe shirt during the 6 January 2021 riot at Capitol Hill, where Trump supporters attempted to prevent his loss to Joe Biden Its creator, artist Matt Furie, has been vocal about his distaste for how the image has been used. The frog first appeared in a series of comics in 2005 - apolitical and best known for pulling his pants all the way down to pee. In the 2020 documentary Feels Good Man, which chronicles Mr Furie's efforts to wrest back control of his work, he said his Pepe drawing was inspired by his experiences with friends and roommates in his 20s. But that changed on 2 October, when a confrontation between a protestor dressed in an inflatable frog costume with a blue neck scarf and an immigration officer in Portland, Oregon, went viral. Mr Todd's attire was not too unusual for Portland, known for its quirky culture and left-wing protests that revel in the absurd - public yoga and 80s-style aerobics lessons, and nude cycling groups. While the court ruled in October that Trump had the right to deploy troops, one judge dissented, referencing in her minority ruling the protesters' \"well-known penchant for wearing chicken suits, inflatable frog costumes, or nothing at all when expressing their disagreement with the methods deployed by ICE\". \"Observers may be tempted to view the majority's ruling, which accepts the government's characterization of Portland as a war zone, as merely absurd,\" Judge Susan Graber wrote. \"But today's decision is not merely absurd.\" Trump's deployment was \"permanently\" blocked by courts just a month later, and troops have reportedly departed the area. Controlling the optics What brings both frogs together - Pepe and the Portland frog - is the interplay between the humorous, benign cartoon amphibian and a deeper political meaning. The strategy rests on what Mr Bogad calls the \"irresistible image\" - often silly, it's a \"disarming and charming\" display that calls attention to your ideas without obviously explaining them to a viewer. \"You could go back to the Middle Ages - when people are dominated, they use absurdity to speak the truth a little bit and still have plausible deniability.\" The idea of this approach is three-fold, Mr Bogad says. EPA A frog costume spotted in Berlin during the No Kings protests Getty Images The costumes have been frequently seen at protests in Washington DC He points to Otpor, the Serbian pro-democracy protest movement that supported efforts to overthrow Yugoslav dictator Slobodan Milosevic in 2000 through pranks and street comedy. For years, critics of Chinese President Xi Jinping have shared images of Winnie the Pooh to signal their opposition online, where more bold-faced criticism could face censorship. Pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong have also embraced Pepe, unaware of his political affiliations in the US. At home in Oregon, a group of Portlanders doubled down on the viral fame and banded together to form \"Operation Inflation\", which collects and distributes inflatable costumes to protesters. They started a website where supporters can donate $35 to buy suits \"for community members to wear at ICE protest sites to help deflate (pun intended) the tensions surrounding protests\". Brooks Brown, a co-founder of Operation Inflation, says the point is to \"shift the story that's being told\", by the Trump administration, that all protesters are part of a violent mob. Brown says the inflatables bear similarities with the Civil Rights era of the 1960s, when protesters would often dress in their Sunday finest and sit motionless as they were harassed by counter-protesters and arrested by aggressive police. Pepe, Mr Brown says, \"was a fascist symbol for 4chan. Feels good man.\" By late October, his group had bought more than 350 outfits, and is planning a \"pipeline\" to send supplies to other cities where inflatables have been used at protests. Once synonymous with the right, the Portland frog has now been sometimes dubbed the \"Antifa Frog\" online - referencing the decentralised, leftist movement that opposes far-right causes and has been designated a domestic terrorist group by Trump.",

Müzik tarzlarının karışımını dünyaya getirmek için çok şey yapan 82 yaşındaki öncü, altmış yıllık performans kariyerinin ardından geçen ay Londra'da son canlı konserini verdi. Yirmi yıl önce, 2005 Hollywood filmi Broken Flowers'ın müziğine kendi müziğini de dahil etmesiyle daha geniş bir dinleyici kitlesi kazandı ve kayıtlarından birinin geçen yılın en iyi filmi olan Oscar adayı Nickel Boys'ta kullanılması daha fazla ilgi gördü. Ancak 1960'lardan bu yana stüdyoyu ve prova odasını, Etiyopya cazının \"bilimi\" olarak adlandırdığı şeyi yaratmak için müzik tarzlarını karıştırdığı bir laboratuvar olarak kullandı. Dışarıda soğuk bir Kasım akşamıydı ama West End'deki mekanın içinde Mulatu, bu simyacıyı iş başındayken son kez görmek isteyen kalabalığın sıcak kucaklamalarıyla yıkanmıştı. Etiyopyalı sanatçı Afework Tekle'nin eserinin yer aldığı bir gömlek giyerek yavaş ve istikrarlı bir şekilde sahneye çıktı. Mulatu Astatke Mulatu, stüdyoda ve konser salonunda kendi Ethio-caz sesini yaratmak için çalışıyor. Sağ elinde ve solunda bir adet pembe keçeli tokmakla, ksilofon benzeri metal çubuklara ustalıkla vurarak hassas, rezonanslı bir ses yaratan büyüleyici ritmi ve melodiyi seçmeye başladı. İlk şarkı Etiyopya Ortodoks kilisesinin 4. yüzyıldan kalma bir melodisine dayanıyordu. Bu, onun müzik mirasına ve dünya çapındaki diğer caz gelenekleriyle birleştirildiğinde sesine eşsiz bir tat veren Etiyopya pentatonik dizisine bir selam niteliğindeydi. Mulatu, konserden sonra BBC'ye yumuşak sesiyle \"Gerçekten çok eğlendim\" dedi. ABD'li müzisyen ve besteci Dexter Story için konser \"acı tatlı\"ydı. \"Bu dehaya sahip olamadığımız, dünyayı turlayamayacağımız için çok üzgünüm.\" Ancak onun etkisi kayıtlarında yaşayacak. Mulatu Astatke Mulatu 1960'lardan beri plak yapıyor \"Biri benden onları Etiyopya müziği veya Etiyopya kültürüyle tanıştırmamı istediğinde içgüdüm, çalmaktır Mulatu,\" diyor Londra merkezli hayran Juweria Dino. Çok güzeldi.\" Etiyopya'dan ve hak ettiği takdiri görmediğini düşündüğü daha geniş kıtadan gelen müziği tanıtmaya kararlı. Mulatu, 1943 yılında Etiyopya'nın güneybatısındaki Jimma'da doğdu. Gençken ailesi onu eğitimine devam etmesi için Kuzey Galler'deki Wrexham yakınlarındaki Lindisfarne Koleji'ne gönderdi. O zamanki okul müdürü onun doğal yeteneğini fark etti ve sonunda onu enerjisinin daha fazlasını bu yeteneği geliştirmeye ayırmaya teşvik etti. \"Okulumu bitirdikten sonra bana 'Mulatu, müzisyen olursan başarılı olursun' diyorlardı. Ben de onların tavsiyelerine uydum. Londra'daki Trinity College'a gittim.\" Mulatu Astatke Mulatu dünyayı gezdi - burada, 1972'de New York Times Meydanı'nda görüldü. İngiltere'nin önde gelen müzik kolejlerinden birinde geçirdiği bu dönemi, yolculuğunun biçimlendirici bir parçası olarak hatırlıyor. \"[Jamaikalı] Joe Harriot en büyük alto saksafon oyuncularından biriydi ve Londra'daki Metro Club adlı bir yerde birlikte çalardık\" dedi. Mulatu bugüne kadar İngiltere'yi kalbinde tutuyor. \"Bana göre buraya tekrar dönmek gerçekten harikaydı.\" 1960'larda Mulatu, Boston'daki Berklee Müzik Koleji'ne kaydolmak için ABD'ye taşındı ve bunu yapan ilk Afrikalı oldu. Vibrafon ve perküsyon eğitimi aldı ve ilk iki albümünü kaydederek Latin cazını kendi müziğine dahil etmeye başladı. Ancak 1969'da Addis Ababa'ya döndüğünde kendi sesini yarattı. Mulatu, Berklee'de öğrendiklerini Etiyopya usulleriyle birleştirerek \"Etiyo-caz adı verilen bu bilimi yarattığını\" söyledi. 1974'te İmparator Haile Selassie'nin darbeyle tahttan indirilmesinin ardından birçok müzisyen ülkeyi terk etti ancak Mulatu Addis'te kaldı ve müzik yapmaya devam etti. Kariyeri boyunca en derin ilham kaynağı, \"bilim adamlarımız\" olarak adlandırdığı memleketindeki geleneksel müzisyenlerden geldi. Parçaları, anayurdundan gelen, washint (flüt), kebero (davul) ve tek telli keman olan masenqo gibi geleneksel enstrümanları bir araya getiriyor. Ama biz onlara itibar etmiyoruz.\" Bugün, misyonunun, sesi \"bilgisayarlaştırarak\" memleketinin geleneksel enstrümanlarının yelpazesini genişletmek olduğunu söylüyor. Konsere giden Joseph Badawi-Crook, \"Bana, Afrika perküsyon seslerinin yanı sıra, bana daha çok Arap müziğini hatırlatan pentatonik gamla harmanlanmış Güney Asya'dan birçok müziği hatırlatıyor\" dedi. \"Tamamen benzersiz bir karışım ve ben ona yıllar önce aşık oldum.\" Mulatu'nun mirası nesillere yayılıyor: \"Bazı büyükanne ve büyükbabalarımız, ebeveynlerimiz, teyzelerimiz veya amcalarımız, Mulatu'yu kariyeri boyunca gördü\" dedi Londra merkezli Etiyopyalı hayran Solliana Kineferigb, \"Aynı zamanda genç neslin bir parçası olmak ve onu hala canlı izleme fırsatına sahip olmak harika.\"",

      "summary_tr_long": "One general, one mathematician: The men competing for power in two African elections Paul Melly West Africa analyst AFP via Getty Images Voters in Guinea and the Central African Republic will get to vote for president On Sunday, citizens of Guinea and the Central African Republic (CAR) will go to the polls to elect their presidents for terms of office of seven years. Yet in both, the incumbents are strong favourites, with observers predicting they will clinch victory outright in the first round with more than 50% of the vote. The CAR, vast and landlocked, is one of Africa's poorest countries, marred by chronic instability for decades, with a succession of armed groups motivated by a variety of local grievances, opportunities for racketeering or political ambitions. From 2013 to 2016 it was only the intervention of African, French and then UN peacekeepers that averted a slide into deeper inter-communal violence. The national government in Bangui, the riverside capital on the southern border, just across the water from the Democratic Republic of Congo, has often struggled to assert its authority in the distant outer-lying regions of the north or far east. AFP via Getty Images President Faustin-Archange Touadéra is hoping for a third term in office President Faustin-Archange Touadéra is a mathematician and former university vice-chancellor. This contrasts with the situation in Guinea, on Africa's west coast, where Gen Mamadi Doumbouya, leader of the September 2021 coup that deposed the 83-year old civilian President Alpha Condé, is now preparing to convert himself into a constitutionally elected ruler. Although Doumbouya will face eight challengers at the ballot box, he has dominated the campaign, with his image plastered all over the streets of Conakry, Guinea's capital city. The most prominent opposition figure of the past 10 years, Cellou Dalein Diallo, with a big personal following among the large Peul community who account for about 40% of the electorate, has been excluded from the contest. Despite these constraints on the political choice presented to voters, the return of an elected government will come as a great relief to the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), a regional bloc that promotes economic integration, democracy, and military cooperation among its members. Almost a year ago, it suffered a blow with the withdrawal of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger after the military regimes that had seized power in a wave of coups between 2020 and 2023 refused to comply with the bloc's demands to commit to clear timeframes for the restoration of civilian rule. AFP via Getty Images From 2021 (L) to today (R) - Mamadi Doumbouya now wants to be a civilian president Doumbouya made a different choice. Although he kept good relations with the junta in neighbouring Mali, he has pursued a methodical constitutional review, which has laid the ground for Sunday's vote, even if this has been delayed for longer than Ecowas originally wanted. His approach to international relations also contrasts starkly with neighbouring regimes, who have cultivated close security ties with Russia and repudiated their previous close partnerships with France. His overthrow of Condé - who had staged a dubious constitutional referendum to allow himself the chance to stand for a third term and had overseen frequent bouts of security force brutality - was celebrated on the streets of Conakry and barely criticised abroad. AFP via Getty Images Gen Mamadi Doumbouya has dominated the build-up to the election Doumbouya earned international goodwill when he pressed quickly ahead with the long-delayed trial of those accused of a notorious 2009 stadium massacre when about 150 opposition supporters were killed and many women raped. And even though his own rule saw youth protesters shot, and leading civil society activists Billo Bah and Foniké Mengué detained and never heard from since, regional and international reactions were muted. Guinea's decision to stay in the bloc and restore elected government - even if it breaches Doumbouya's earlier promise that no member of his junta would stand in the polls - has been greeted with quiet relief by many regional leaders and European governments, as a step towards reconsolidating normality. With jihadist groups now disrupting daily life and trade across the south of Mali and Burkina Faso, the gradual progress towards constitutional stability in Guinea, despite persistent civil-rights concerns, has been welcomed. The same goes for Touadéra's bid for a third term in the CAR, a country slowly emerging from years of insecurity. The UN peacekeeping force, Minusca, is helping the government to gradually restore basic administration and services, even to distant provincial towns. The CAR still significantly relies on Russian military advice, but the president has taken time to rebuild good relations with France and maintain a close partnership with the EU and the UN. With war-ravaged Sudan just over the north-eastern border, and deep fragilities still persistent at home, international partners are minded to support rather than criticise, despite the frustrations of those opponents who feel that a Touadéra third term would be illegitimate.

      "summary_tr_long": "'We will vote but not with our hearts': Inside the election staged by Myanmar's military rulers Jonathan Head South East Asia correspondent, Mandalay, Myanmar Jonathan Head/ BBC A campaign rally in Mandalay ahead of a controversial election being held by Myanmar's military rulers on 28 December On a patch of rough ground near the Irrawaddy River, aspiring member of parliament and retired Lieutenant-General Tayza Kyaw tries to muster some enthusiasm from his audience with a speech promising them better times. He is the candidate for the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), backed by Myanmar's military, in Aungmyaythazan, a constituency in the city of Mandalay. The crowd of 300-400 clutch the branded hats and flags they've been given, but soon wilt in the afternoon heat, some dozing off. A 'sham' election On Sunday the people of Myanmar get their first opportunity to vote in an election since the military seized power in a coup nearly five years ago, setting off a devastating civil war. When the BBC tried asking people at the rally in Mandalay what they thought of the election, we were told not to by party officials. In a dictatorship which has criminalised liking Facebook pages criticising the election, or using the word revolution, even these staunchly pro-military party activists feared the consequences of allowing a foreign journalist the chance to ask uncensored questions. Lulu Luo/ BBC Most people we encountered did not want to discuss the election The military authorities imposed a new law in July criminalising \"any speech, organising, inciting, protesting, or distributing leaflets in order to destroy a part of the electoral process\". Earlier this month Tayzar San, a doctor and one of the first to organise a protest against the 2021 coup, was also among the first to be charged under the law, after he distributed leaflets calling for a boycott of the election. In September three young people in Yangon were given sentences of 42 to 49 years each for posting stickers showing a bullet and a ballot box together. Tayzar San/Facebook Tayzar San distributing leaflets boycotting the election \"Co-operate and crush all those harming the union,\" commands a large red poster looming over the families and couples enjoying a late afternoon stroll under the old red-brick walls of the royal palace in Mandalay. He seems confident this extraordinary election, where there will be no voting at all in as much as one half of the country, will give him the legitimacy he has failed to acquire during his five catastrophic years in power. He even attended a Christmas mass in Yangon's cathedral and condemned the \"hatred and resentment between individuals\" which led to \"domination, oppression, and violence in human communities\". This, from a man charged by the UN and human rights groups with genocide against Muslim Rohingyas, whose coup set off a civil war which, according to the data analysis group ACLED, has killed 90,000 people. AFP via Getty Images Myanmar's military ruler Min Aung Hlaing Min Aung Hlaing's election gambit has the full diplomatic support of China, which, bizarrely for a one-party state, is giving technical and financial support for this multi-party exercise. With Aung San Suu Kyi and her NLD out of the picture his USDP is all but guaranteed to win. In the last, free election in 2020, the USDP won only six percent of parliamentary seats. He will probably keep the presidency after the election, but his power will, to some extent, be diluted by the resumption of parliamentary politics, albeit without most of the parties that won seats in the 2020 election. 'No-one is ready to compromise' Even a short distance from the apparently peaceful city life of Mandalay, the deep scars left by Myanmar's civil war, which is still far from over, are visible. Getting there requires a short drive along a riverside road, but for the past four years this, like much of the area around Mandalay, has been contested territory, where volunteer People's Defence Forces control many villages and launch ambushes against army convoys. Lulu Luo/ BBC Many young men have taken up arms on both sides of this conflict He said he had to carry these weapons just to move about the village. On his phone were images of his opponents: young men, raggedly dressed, with an assortment of weapons they may have smuggled from border regions of Myanmar or obtained from dead soldiers and police officers. Jonathan Head/ BBC Crowds outside the old royal palace in Mandalay There is little sign of compromise either from the military men who overturned Myanmar's young democracy, and who now want to revamp their regime with a veneer of quasi-democratic respectability. Asked about the appalling civilian casualties since the coup, and the air strikes against schools and hospitals, General Tayza Kyaw blamed them entirely on those who opposed the military takeover. So, they are just terrorists.\" People in Mandalay say this election has none of the colour and energy of the 2020 election. Only five other parties are being allowed to challenge the USDP nationwide, and none has its resources and institutional backing.",

Kaçırılma olayı CCTV'de kaydedildi ve ülke yıllarca etkisi altına alındı. Yüksek mahkeme, polisin seçkin Özel Şubesi'nin Raymond Koh'u götürdüğüne karar verdi ve ülkenin ilk zorla kaybetme davasından hem polisi hem de Malezya hükümetini sorumlu tuttu. Kocasının neden kaçırıldığı kesin ancak iki bağımsız resmi soruşturma, polisin papazı Malezya'nın çoğunluk dini olan İslam'a yönelik bir tehdit olarak gördüğünü ortaya çıkardı. Mahkeme zaferinden kısa bir süre sonra BBC'ye konuşan Bayan Liew, \"İçimden bir ses şöyle dedi: 'Böylece onu gizlice götürdüler; tüm dünyaya haber vereceğim'.\" Bay Koh, arkadaşlarıyla buluşmak için ailesinin evini terk etti. 63 yaşındaki adam, Kuala Lumpur'un sakin bir banliyösündeki evinden çıkarken, bir SUV ve motosiklet konvoyu aracına doğru ilerledi. Sonraki günlerde Bay Koh'un çocukları, babalarının ortadan kaybolmasıyla ilgili ipuçları bulmak için kapı kapı gittiler ve birkaç ay önce, kuzey eyaletinden Amri Che Mat adlı bir aktivistin tüm olayı iki evin CCTV kameralarıyla görüntülediğini keşfettiler. Perlis de neredeyse aynı şekilde kaçırılmıştı ve CCTV görüntüleri, yerel bir gazete tarafından internette yayınlandığında anında viral oldu. Raymond Koh'un ailesi Papaz Raymond Koh, 2017 yılında Kuala Lumpur'da kaçırıldı. Bu arada, Bay Koh'un ortadan kaybolması ailesini olumsuz yönde etkiledi. \"Çok travma geçirdim.\" Bay Koh bir papaz olduğundan, 2011 yılında Bay Koh, bazı Müslümanların da katıldığı bir kilisede bir parti düzenlediğinde irtidatla suçlanmıştı. Bayan Liew, \"polisin soruşturma konusunda açık sözlü olmadığını ve hatta bazen gerçeği öğrenmemizi engellediğini ve yanıltıcı bilgiler ürettiğini\" söyledi. Malezya polisinden bu iddialara yanıt istedi Araba ve itiraf Mayıs 2018'de bir gece geç saatlerde, 2016 yılında kaçırılan aktivist Amri Che Mat'ın eşi Norhayati'nin evine bir adam geldi. Nisan 2019'da komisyon, Raymond Koh ve Amri Che Mat'ın kaçırılmasından Özel Şube'nin sorumlu olduğu sonucuna vardı. BBC, yanıtı için şu anda emekli olan Bay Awaludin ile iletişime geçmeye çalıştı. Bu bulgulara göre, ABD Dışişleri Bakanlığı Bayan Liew, 2020'de Melania Trump ve Mike Pompeo'dan madalya aldı. 2020'de Bayan Liew, kendisi ve kayıp kocası adına çok sayıda üst düzey polis memuruna, Malezya Kraliyet Polisi'ne ve Malezya hükümetine karşı bir hukuk davası açtı. Yargıç, duygusal sıkıntı nedeniyle Bayan Liew'e birkaç milyon ringgit ödenmesinin yanı sıra, Bay Koh'un nerede olduğu açıklanana kadar ortadan kaybolduğu her gün için bir vakfa 10.000 ringgit (1.830 £; 2.385 $) ödenmesine karar verdi. Bugüne kadar bu meblağ 32 milyon ringgiti aştı ve nihai rakamın Malezya tarihindeki en büyük ödeme olması bekleniyor. Ancak hükümet bu kararlara itiraz ediyor. BBC, polisten karar hakkında yorum yapmasını istedi. 2020'de ABD'nin kendisine Uluslararası Cesur Kadınlar madalyası verdiğini söyledi. \"Ama asıl şüpheliyle yüz yüze geldiğimde hiçbir nefret hissetmedim... Tanrı'nın önünde gerçekten haklı ve saf olmak istiyorum.\" Ancak affetmek onun adalet arayışını durduracağı anlamına gelmiyor.

Bir Fransız eski AB komiseri ve Almanya merkezli çevrimiçi nefret karşıtı bir gruptan iki üst düzey ismin de vize başvurusu reddedildi. Avrupalı ​​liderler tedbirleri kınarken, Birleşik Krallık hükümeti ifade özgürlüğünü desteklemeye \"tamamen kararlı\" olduğunu söyledi. Birleşik Krallık hükümet sözcüsü, \"Her ülke kendi vize kurallarını belirleme hakkına sahip olsa da, interneti en zararlı içerikten uzak tutmak için çalışan yasa ve kurumları destekliyoruz\" dedi. Fransa Cumhurbaşkanı Emmanuel Macron, seyahat yasağını \"Avrupa'nın dijital egemenliğini baltalamayı amaçlayan gözdağı ve baskı\" olarak tanımlarken, AB'nin dış politika şefi Kaja Kallas bunun \"kabul edilemez ve egemenliğimize meydan okumaya yönelik bir girişim\" olduğunu söyledi. ABD, bu önlemleri, Amerikan teknoloji şirketlerine kısıtlama getirilmesi için kampanya yürüten kişi ve kuruluşlara yanıt olarak ilan etti ve Dışişleri Bakanı Marco Rubio bunların \"küresel sansür-endüstriyel kompleks\"e ait olduğunu söyledi.

Daha önce Çalışma Bakanı Hilary Benn'in yardımcısıydı ve Sir Keir Starmer'ın özel kalemi Morgan McSweeney, kurduğu grupta yönetici olarak görev yaptı. ABD hükümeti, Ahmed'i CCDH'nin Biden yönetimiyle yaptığı iddia edilen geçmiş çalışmaların \"işbirlikçisi\" olarak nitelendirdi. Melford, 2018'de dezenformasyonun yayılmasını izleyen kar amacı gütmeyen bir kuruluş olan GDI'yı kurdu. ABD Dışişleri Müsteşarı Sarah B Rogers, GDI'yı ABD vergi mükelleflerinin parasını \"Amerikan konuşma ve basınının sansürlenmesini ve kara listeye alınmasını teşvik etmek için\" kullanmakla suçladı. Bir GDI sözcüsü BBC'ye \"bugün açıklanan vize yaptırımlarının ifade özgürlüğüne yönelik otoriter bir saldırı ve korkunç bir hükümet sansürü eylemi olduğunu\" söyledi. \"Trump Yönetimi, bir kez daha, aynı fikirde olmadıkları sesleri sindirmek, sansürlemek ve susturmak için federal hükümetin tüm ağırlığını kullanıyor. Bugünkü eylemleri ahlaka aykırı, yasa dışı ve Amerikalılığa aykırı.\" Ayrıca, bir \"cadı avı\" yürütüldüğünü öne süren Avrupa Komisyonu'nun eski üst düzey teknoloji düzenleyicisi Thierry Breton da hedef alındı. Breton, Dışişleri Bakanlığı tarafından sosyal medya firmalarına içerik denetimi uygulayan AB'nin Dijital Hizmetler Yasası'nın (DSA) \"beyni\" olarak tanımlandı. Ancak bu durum, bunu sağcı görüşleri sansürleme çabası olarak gören bazı ABD'li muhafazakarları kızdırdı. Breton, dünyanın en zengin adamı ve X'in sahibi Elon Musk ile AB kurallarına uyma yükümlülükleri konusunda çatıştı. Avrupa Komisyonu yakın zamanda mavi onay işaretleri nedeniyle X 120 milyon Euro (105 milyon £) para cezasına çarptırıldı; bu, DSA kapsamındaki ilk para cezası. Şirketin \"kullanıcıları anlamlı bir şekilde doğrulamaması\" nedeniyle platformun mavi onay sisteminin \"aldatıcı\" olduğu belirtildi. Buna yanıt olarak Musk'un sitesi Komisyonun kendi platformunda reklam paylaşmasını engelledi. Vize yasağına tepki gösteren Breton, X'te şunları paylaştı: \"Amerikalı dostlarımıza: Sansür sandığınız yerde değil.\" Ayrıca, Dışişleri Bakanlığı'nın DSA'nın uygulanmasına yardımcı olduğunu söylediği bir Alman kuruluşu olan HateAid'den Anna-Lena von Hodenberg ve Josephine Ballon da yasaklara maruz kaldı. BBC'ye yaptıkları açıklamada iki CEO, bunu \"hukukun üstünlüğünü giderek daha fazla hiçe sayan ve kendisini eleştirenleri her ne şekilde olursa olsun susturmaya çalışan bir hükümetin baskı eylemi\" olarak nitelendirdi. Şöyle eklediler: \"İnsan haklarını ve ifade özgürlüğünü savunanları susturmak için sansür suçlamalarını kullanan bir hükümetten korkmayacağız.\"",

Zampella'nın ölümü, kurucularından olduğu Respawn Entertainment'ın sahibi Electronic Arts tarafından doğrulandı. Etkili video oyunu geliştiricisi, Pazar günü Los Angeles'ta bir otoyolda kaza yapıp alev aldığında başka bir kişiyle birlikte Ferrari'de seyahat ediyordu. Electronic Arts'ın bir sözcüsü BBC'ye şunları söyledi: \"Bu hayal bile edilemeyecek bir kayıp ve kalplerimiz Vince'in ailesiyle, sevdikleriyle ve çalışmalarından etkilenen herkesle birlikte.\" Yetkililer, sürücünün sıkışıp kaldığı sırada aracın yolcu koltuğundaki kişinin fırladığını söyledi.

Aynı zamanda yakında çıkacak bir canlı aksiyon filminin de ortaya çıkmasına neden oldu. Call of Duty serisi onun tek başarısı değildi. Ayrıca Medal of Honor, Titanfall ve Apex Legends gibi diğer popüler oyunların da arkasındaydı. Gazeteci ve Oyun Ödülleri sunucusu, Titanfall'un yapımı hakkında bir kitap yazan Geoff Keighley, X hakkındaki gönderisinde Zampella'yı \"sevgili bir arkadaş\" ve \"dürüstlük ve şeffaflığa olan bağlılığından asla taviz vermeyen\" \"vizyon sahibi bir yönetici\" olarak nitelendirdi. \"Zamanımızın en etkili oyunlarından bazılarını yaratırken, her zaman en büyük oyununun önünde olduğunu hissettim\" dedi. \"Asla oynayamayacak olmamız yürek parçalayıcı.\" Guardian'ın video oyunları editörü Keza MacDonald, BBC Newshour'a \"Oyuncu deneyimini gerçekten önemsiyordu\" dedi. \"Oyun yapmayı önemsiyordu, insanların oyun oynarken nasıl hissettiklerini önemsiyordu ve bu, onunla ne zaman konuşsanız gerçekten ortaya çıkıyor.\" Call of Duty videoları kendisine 2,4 milyondan fazla abone kazandıran YouTuber MrRoflWaffles, geliştiricinin kendi içeriği de dahil olmak üzere seriyle \"tüm bir nesle\" ilham verdiği için itibar etti. BBC Newsbeat'e şunları söyledi: \"Oyun dünyasının Rushmore Dağı'ndan bahsediyorsunuz; kendisi kesinlikle bu listenin en önemli isimlerinden biri.\" 2010 yılında Zampella ve West, Call of Duty oyunlarını yayınlayan Activision'dan kovuldu ve ikili, daha sonra 2012'de mahkeme dışında anlaştıkları şirketle uzun bir anlaşmazlığa düştü. Zampella, Electronic Arts'ta Call of Duty'nin doğrudan rakibi olarak görülen Battlefield 6 üzerinde çalıştı. Call of Duty'yi geliştiren Amerikan şirketi Infinity Ward, Zampella'nın \"tarihimizde her zaman özel bir yeri olacağını\" söyledi. Şirket, X hakkında yaptığı açıklamada, \"İkonik, kalıcı eğlence yaratma mirasınız ölçülemez\" dedi.",

İki şirket, otonom araçları Londra'da test etmek için düzenleyicilerden onay almayı umuyor. Baidu'nun Apollo Go sürücüsüz taksi hizmeti, çoğunlukla Çin'de olmak üzere düzinelerce şehirde halihazırda faaliyet gösteriyor ve direksiyon başında insan olmadan milyonlarca yolculuk gerçekleştirdi. Ulaştırma Bakanı Heidi Alexander, haberin \"kendi kendine giden araçlara yönelik planlarımıza yönelik bir başka güven oyu\" olduğunu söyledi ancak çoğu kişi bunların güvenliği konusunda şüpheci olmaya devam ediyor. Bayan Alexander, X'teki bir gönderisinde şunları söyledi: \"Pilot programımız kapsamında, bahardan itibaren ilk kez yolcu taşıyacak sürücüsüz arabaları planlıyoruz - seyahati dönüştürmek için bu teknolojiyi güvenli ve sorumlu bir şekilde kullanacağız.\" Uber, haziran ayında, hükümetin 2026'da pilotların küçük otonom \"otobüs ve taksi benzeri\" ticari hizmetlere izin verme çerçevesini hızlandırmaya çalışması nedeniyle Birleşik Krallık'taki sürücüsüz arabaları deneme planlarını öne süreceğini söyledi. Pazartesi günü Baidu ortaklığıyla ilgili olarak \"İngiltere'nin mobilitenin geleceğindeki liderliğini hızlandırmaktan ve gelecek yıl Londralılara başka bir güvenli ve güvenilir seyahat seçeneği sunmaktan heyecan duyuyoruz\" dedi. Lyft, ağustos ayında Baidu ile yapılan Avrupa anlaşmasının bir parçası olarak İngiltere ve Almanya'da sürücüsüz taksileri konuşlandırmayı düşüneceğini söyledi. Uber'in Waymo ile olan ortaklığı aracılığıyla bir robotaksi hizmeti de yürüttüğü ABD'nin Atlanta kentinde halihazırda \"otonom sürüşler\" gerçekleştiriyor. Lyft CEO'su David Risher, Pazartesi günü X'te yayınlanan bir gönderide Londra yolcularının \"Baidu'nun Apollo Go araçlarını bölgede deneyimleyen ilk kişiler\" olacağını söyledi. Ancak her iki firmanın da düzenleyicileri ikna etmesi gerekiyor. Bay Risher, eğer yeşil ışık yanarsa Lyft'in düzinelerce Baidu Apollo Go arabasından oluşan ilk filosunun \"bundan sonra yüzlerce arabaya ölçeklendirme planlarıyla\" gelecek yıl testlere başlayacağını söyledi. Ancak University College London'da bilim ve teknoloji politikası profesörü Jack Stilgoe, sürücüsüz arabaların \"diğer dijital teknolojiler gibi ölçeklenemeyeceğini\" söyledi. BBC'ye yaptığı açıklamada, \"Kamuya açık sokakları laboratuvar olarak kullanan birkaç test aracına sahip olmak ile insanlar için gerçek bir ulaşım seçeneği haline gelen tam gelişmiş, ölçeği büyütülmüş bir sistem arasında büyük bir fark var\" dedi. Trafik sıkışıklığı endişeleri Sürücüsüz araçlar sıklıkla taşımacılığın geleceği olarak övülüyor ve bazıları insan sürücülerden daha az hata yaptıklarını iddia ediyor. Ancak birçok kişi, insan operatörsüz taksilerin güvenliği konusunda tedirgin olmaya devam ediyor. Ekim ayında yapılan YouGov anketine katılan Birleşik Krallık'taki katılımcıların neredeyse %60'ı, sürücüsüz bir taksiye binerken hiçbir koşulda kendilerini rahat hissetmeyeceklerini söyledi. Birçoğu teknolojiye güvenmediklerini de ifade etti; %85'i aynı fiyat ve kolaylık sağlanırsa insan şoförlü bir taksiyi tercih edeceklerini söyledi. Otonom araçların hata yapması, yolcuları arabaların içinde sıkıştırması ve trafik sıkışıklığına veya kazalara neden olması da manşetlerde yer almaya devam ediyor. Sürücüsüz taksi operatörü Waymo'nun, bazı araçlarının elektrik kesintisi sırasında çalışmayı durdurmasının ardından Cumartesi günü San Francisco'daki hizmetini askıya aldığı bildirildi. Prof Stilgoe, güvenlikleri, mahremiyetleri ve trafik sıkışıklığını artırma potansiyeli konusundaki endişeler nedeniyle İngiltere'nin \"teknoloji için standartlar belirlemede\" öncülük etmesi gerektiğini söyledi. \"Londra, arabaları şehir merkezinden çıkarma konusunda gerçekten başarılı oldu\" dedi. \"Trafik söz konusu olduğunda, tek kişilik bir arabadan daha kötü olan tek şey, sıfır doluluktur.\"",

Peki bu, uygulamayı kullanan 170 milyondan fazla Amerikalı (veya sosyal medya platformunun iddia ettiği gibi) için ne anlama geliyor? Anahtar, TikTok'un öneri algoritmasının (izleyebileceğiniz içeriği tahmin etmek için platformun Sizin İçin Sayfasını düzenleyen güçlü sistem) el değiştirdiğinde nasıl yönetildiği olabilir.

'Köşeleri yumuşatmak' Şu anda TikTok'un sistemi, önerileri anında değiştirebilen büyük miktarda küresel veriye ve geri bildirim döngülerine bağlı. Anlaşma şartlarına göre, yatırımcı Oracle tarafından lisanslanacak olan TikTok'un algoritması, Amerikan kullanıcı verileri üzerinde yeniden eğitilecek. Bay Navarra, bunun uygulamanın \"daha güvenli ve sağlam\" hissetmesine neden olabileceğini ancak bunun sonucunda \"kültürel açıdan daha az gerekli hale gelme\" riskiyle karşı karşıya kalabileceğini söyledi. \"TikTok'un gücü her zaman biraz kontrolden çıkmış hissetmesinden kaynaklanmaktadır; garip, niş, rahatsız edici, bazen başkaları için veya başka bir yere gitmeden önce politik açıdan keskin içerik\" dedi. \"Bu kenarları yumuşatmaya başlarsanız, yalnızca ölçüyü değiştirmezsiniz.

Singapur Ulusal Üniversitesi'nden bilgi işlem uzmanı Kokil Jaidka, kısa videolar ve alışveriş gibi platformu popüler kılan şeylerin, bu özellikler algoritmaya bağlı olmadığı için muhtemelen \"bozulmadan kalacağını\" beklediğini söyledi. \"Silolanmış\" ABD sürümünün daha dar veri girişlerinin uygulamanın küresel erişimiyle eşleşip eşleşmeyeceğine bağlı olarak değişikliklerin daha incelikli ve kademeli olabileceğini söyledi. \"TikTok, öneri algoritmasının lisanslı veya kısmen seyreltilmiş bir sürümüyle çalışıyorsa, sistemin bazı kör noktaları daha fazla önem kazanmaya başlayabilir\" dedi. Kullanıcılar açısından bunun, pratikte ABD algoritmasının \"kişiselleştirmede gecikebileceği\" ve viral içeriğe uyum sağlamasının daha uzun süreceği anlamına geldiğini söyledi. Oracle, TikTok'un ABD'deki uzun süreli bulut bilişim ortağıdır ve başkanlığını Başkan Trump'ın müttefiki Larry Ellison yapmaktadır.

Video platformunun patronu perşembe günü çalışanlara, TikTok'un Çinli sahibi ByteDance'in ABD'de faaliyet göstermek üzere Amerikalı ve küresel yatırımcılarla bağlayıcı anlaşmalar imzaladığını söyledi. CEO Shou Zi Chew tarafından gönderilen bir nota göre, ortak girişimin yarısı Oracle, Silver Lake ve Emirlik yatırım şirketi MGX'in de aralarında bulunduğu bir grup yatırımcıya ait olacak. 22 Ocak'ta sonuçlanması planlanan anlaşma, Washington'un ByteDance'i ulusal güvenlik kaygıları nedeniyle ABD operasyonlarını satmaya zorlamak için yıllardır yürüttüğü çabalara son verecek. Bu, ABD Başkanı Donald Trump'ın, uygulamayı satılmadığı sürece yasaklayacak bir yasanın yürürlüğe girmesini geciktirdiği Eylül ayında açıklanan bir anlaşmayla uyumlu. TikTok notunda, anlaşmanın \"170 milyondan fazla Amerikalının hayati bir küresel topluluğun parçası olarak sonsuz olasılıklarla dolu bir dünyayı keşfetmeye devam etmesine\" olanak sağlayacağını söyledi. Anlaşmaya göre ByteDance işin %19,9'unu elinde tutacak; Oracle, Silver Lake ve Abu Dhabi merkezli MGX ise %15'er hisseye sahip olacak. Bildiriye göre, diğer %30,1'lik kısım mevcut ByteDance yatırımcılarının iştirakleri tarafından tutulacak. Beyaz Saray daha önce, Trump destekçisi Larry Ellison tarafından kurulan Oracle'ın, anlaşmanın bir parçası olarak TikTok'un öneri algoritmasını lisanslayacağını söylemişti. Nisan 2024'te, Başkan Joe Biden'ın yönetimi sırasında ABD Kongresi, satılmadığı sürece uygulamanın ulusal güvenlik kaygıları nedeniyle yasaklanmasını öngören bir yasayı kabul etti. Yasanın 20 Ocak 2025'te yürürlüğe girmesi planlanıyordu ancak yönetimi mülkiyeti devretmek için bir anlaşma üzerinde çalışırken Trump tarafından birçok kez geri çekildi. Trump, eylül ayında Çin Devlet Başkanı Xi Jinping ile telefonda konuştuğunu ve onun anlaşmaya onay verdiğini söylemişti. Liderlerin Ekim ayında yüz yüze görüşmesinin ardından platformun geleceği belirsizliğini korudu. Uygulamanın kaderi, iki ülke arasında ticaret de dahil olmak üzere diğer konularda devam eden gerilimler nedeniyle gölgelendi. Massachusetts Teknoloji Enstitüsü'nde öğretim görevlisi olan Alvin Graylin, \"TikTok, daha geniş ABD-Çin ilişkisinde bir pazarlık kozu haline geldi\" dedi. \"Son zamanlarda yumuşayan gerilimlerle birlikte, Pekin'in yapı ve algoritma lisanslaması konusundaki imzası artık teslimiyetten ziyade, her iki başkentin de kendi evinde galibiyet iddia etmesine izin veren, ayarlanmış bir gerilim azaltma gibi görünüyor.\" Beyaz Saray, yorum almak için iletişime geçtiğinde BBC'yi TikTok'a yönlendirdi. Anlaşma, \"Amerikalı kullanıcının mahremiyetini korumak için hiçbir şey yapmayacağını\" söyleyen Oregon'lu Senato Demokratı Ron Wyden tarafından eleştirildi. Şartlara göre, TikTok'un öneri algoritması, yayınların harici manipülasyondan arınmış olmasını sağlamak için ABD kullanıcı verileri üzerinde yeniden eğitilecek. Wyden, \"TikTok'un algoritmasını daha güvenli ellere verip vermeyeceği bile belli değil\" dedi. 2024 yasasına karşı çıktı ve Kongre'ye Çin'den gelen tehditleri hafifletmesi için daha fazla zaman vermek amacıyla Ocak ayında TikTok'un son tarihini uzatmak için lobi yapan ABD'li milletvekilleri arasında yer aldı. Bazı kullanıcılar da yeni yatırımcıların beklentilerine karşı dikkatli olduklarını ifade etti. Platformda 300.000'den fazla takipçisi ve yaklaşık dört milyon beğenisi bulunan küçük işletme sahibi Tiffany Cianci, gelen yatırımcıların kendisi gibi girişimciler için aynı kullanıcı deneyimini sürdürmesini umduğunu söyledi. \"Umarım küçük işletme sahipleri korunur\" dedi. TikTok, ABD'de yedi milyondan fazla küçük işletmenin ürün ve hizmetlerini TikTok'ta pazarladığını söyledi. Bayan Cianci, \"Uygulamayı bu küçük işletmeler için kaydedip kaydetmediğimiz konusunda kararımı saklı tutuyorum\" dedi. Platform, Meta gibi rakiplerin sunduğundan daha uygun şartlarda kar paylaşımı sunduğu için tanıtım için TikTok'u seçtiğini ekledi. Geçen yıl Bayan Cianci, uygulamayı kaydetmeyi amaçlayan Washington'da ve TikTok'ta protestolar düzenlemekte aktifti.",

Kadınlara ve kız çocuklarına yönelik şiddeti yarıya indirmeye yönelik daha geniş bir stratejinin parçası olarak Perşembe günü duyurulan yeni yasalar, kullanıcıların görünüşte birinin giysilerini çıkarmak için görüntüleri düzenlemesine olanak tanıyan yapay zeka araçlarının oluşturulmasını ve sağlanmasını yasa dışı hale getirecek. Hükümet, yeni suçların, cinsel içerikli deepfake ve mahrem imaj istismarına ilişkin mevcut kuralların üzerine inşa edileceğini söyledi. Teknoloji Bakanı Liz Kendall, \"Kadınlar ve kız çocukları çevrimdışı olduğu kadar çevrimiçi ortamda da güvende olmayı hak ediyor\" dedi. \"Teknolojinin rıza dışı, müstehcen deepfake'ler yaratarak onları istismar etmek, aşağılamak ve sömürmek için silah haline getirilmesine seyirci kalmayacağız.\" Birinin rızası olmadan derin sahte müstehcen görüntülerini oluşturmak, Çevrimiçi Güvenlik Yasası kapsamında zaten ceza gerektiren bir suçtur. Bayan Kendall, çıplaklık yaratan uygulamaların oluşturulmasını veya dağıtılmasını yasa dışı kılan yeni suçun, \"bunlardan kar elde eden veya bunların kullanılmasını sağlayanların yasanın tüm gücünü hissedeceği\" anlamına geleceğini söyledi. Çıplaklaştırma veya \"giysilerden arındırma\" uygulamaları, bir resim veya videoda bir kişinin kıyafetleri çıkarılmış gibi gerçekçi bir şekilde görünmesini sağlamak için üretken yapay zekayı kullanıyor. Uzmanlar, bu tür uygulamaların yükselişi ve sahte çıplak görüntülerin, özellikle çocukların cinsel istismarı materyali (CSAM) oluşturmak için kullanıldığında mağdurlara ciddi zarar verme potansiyeli hakkında uyarılarda bulundu. Nisan ayında İngiltere Çocuk Komiseri Dame Rachel de Souza, çıplaklık uygulamalarının tamamen yasaklanması çağrısında bulundu. Bir raporda, \"Böyle bir görüntü oluşturma eylemi kesinlikle yasa dışıdır; bunu sağlayan teknolojinin de yasa dışı olması gerekir\" dedi. Hükümet Perşembe günü yaptığı açıklamada, mahrem imajın kötüye kullanılmasıyla mücadele etmek için yöntemler geliştirmek üzere \"teknoloji şirketleriyle güçlerini birleştireceğini\" söyledi. Bunun, Birleşik Krallık güvenlik teknolojisi firması SafeToNet ile çalışmaya devam etmeyi de içereceği belirtildi. Birleşik Krallık'taki şirket, cinsel içeriği tanımlayıp engelleyebileceğini ve ayrıca cinsel içeriğin yakalandığını tespit ettiğinde kameraları engelleyebileceğini iddia ettiği bir yapay zeka yazılımı geliştirdi. Bu tür teknoloji, genellikle çocukların kendi mahrem fotoğraflarını çekmelerini veya paylaşmalarını engellemek amacıyla, görüntülerdeki potansiyel çıplaklığı tespit etmek ve işaretlemek için Meta gibi platformlar tarafından uygulanan mevcut filtreleri temel alır. 'Var olmak için hiçbir neden yok' Çıplaklık yaratan uygulamaların yasaklanması planları, çocuk koruma yardım kuruluşlarının hükümete teknolojiye karşı önlem alması yönünde yaptığı önceki çağrıların ardından geldi. Rapor Kaldırma yardım hattı, 18 yaşın altındaki kişilerin kendilerine ait müstehcen görüntüleri çevrimiçi olarak gizli bir şekilde bildirmelerine olanak tanıyan İnternet İzleme Vakfı (IWF), onaylı muhabirlerin %19'unun görüntülerinin bir kısmının veya tamamının manipüle edildiğini söylediğini söyledi. Şirketin CEO'su Kerry Smith, tedbirleri memnuniyetle karşıladı. \"Ürün olarak var olması için hiçbir nedeni olmayan bu sözde çıplaklaştırma uygulamalarının yasaklanmasına yönelik somut adımları görmekten de memnuniyet duyuyoruz\" dedi. \"Bunun gibi uygulamalar gerçek çocukları daha da büyük bir zarar riskiyle karşı karşıya bırakıyor ve üretilen görüntülerin internetin en karanlık köşelerinden bazılarında toplandığını görüyoruz.\" Ancak çocuklara yönelik hayır kurumu NSPCC haberi memnuniyetle karşılarken, strateji direktörü Dr. Maria Neophytou, zorunlu cihaz düzeyinde korumalar getirme konusunda benzer bir \"tutku\" görmemenin \"hayal kırıklığına uğradığını\" söyledi. Yardım kuruluşu, hükümete, teknoloji firmalarının CSAM'in özel mesajlar gibi hizmetlerinde tespit edilmesi ve yayılmasını önlemenin daha kolay yollarını bulmasını sağlamaya çağıran kuruluşlar arasında yer alıyor.

Alışveriş yapanlar temassız kart limiti kaldırma duyurusuna tepki gösterdi Bir düzenleyici, milyonlarca kişinin kendi temassız kart ödeme limitlerini belirleyebileceğini, hatta hiç limiti olmayacağını doğruladı. Bankalara ve kart sağlayıcılarına Mart ayından itibaren dört haneli PIN kodunu girmeye gerek kalmadan maksimum veya sınırsız tek ödeme tutarı belirleme yetkisi verilecek. Ancak aynı zamanda Mali Davranış Otoritesi (FCA) tarafından kart sahiplerinin kendi bireysel limitlerini belirlemelerine veya temassız çalışmayı tamamen kapatmalarına izin vermeleri yönünde teşvik ediliyorlar. Bu hamle, FCA'nın kendi anketinin, tüketiciler ve sektörden katılımcılar arasında temassız kartlarda mevcut 100 £ limitinin değiştirilmesi konusunda pek istekli olmadığını göstermesine rağmen geldi. FCA, kart sağlayıcılarının Mart ayından itibaren mevcut limitte anında değişiklik yapmasını beklemediğini ancak bunu yapabilecek esnekliğe sahip olduklarını söyledi. Temassız kart ödemeleri 2007 yılında uygulamaya konulduğunda işlem limiti 10 £ olarak belirlendi. Limit, kademeli olarak 2010'da 15 £'a, 2012'de 20 £'a, ardından 2015'te 30 £'a yükseltildi; ardından Kovid salgını 2020'de 45 £'a, ardından Ekim 2021'de 100 £'a yükseldi. Temassız kartların şu anda 100 £ ödeme limiti varken, ödeme yapmak için akıllı telefonunu kullanan herkes PIN'e ihtiyaç duymadan herhangi bir tutarı harcayabilir. Parmak izi ve yüz kimliği gibi yerleşik güvenlik özellikleri daha fazla koruma sağlar. Ancak tek bir kart dokunuşuyla yüksek değerli ödemeler yapılabildiğinden, kartların hırsızlar ve dolandırıcılar için daha çekici hale geleceği konusunda endişeler ortaya çıktı. Bir dizi ardışık temassız işlem yapıldıktan sonra PIN girilmesinin istenmesi gibi çeşitli korumalar halihazırda mevcuttur. FCA'nın ödemeler ve dijital finans genel müdürü David Geale'e göre tüketiciler, dolandırıcılar tarafından çalınsa bile paralarını geri alacaklar. \"Temassız ödeme, insanların tercih ettiği ödeme yöntemidir\" dedi. BBC'nin Today programında konuşan Bay Geale, sistem iyi çalışsa da katı sınırların \"işleri yavaşlatabileceğini\" söyledi. \"Dolayısıyla yapmak istediğimiz şey, bankalara ve ödeme şirketlerine, dolandırıcılık riskinin düşük olduğu temassız ödeme konusunda kendi yaklaşımlarını belirlemeleri için daha fazla esneklik kazandırmak\" dedi. Uygulamada bunun, bankaların ve ödeme şirketlerinin müşterilerine göre bir limit seçebilecekleri anlamına geldiğini söyledi. \"Ancak asıl teşvik ettiğimiz şey, müşterilerin kendi sınırlarını belirlemeleri için bu esnekliği açacak olmalarıdır\" diye ekledi. Kanada, Avustralya ve Yeni Zelanda gibi diğer ülkeler endüstrinin temassız kart limitleri belirlemesine izin veriyor. Bankaları temsil eden UK Finance'in ödemeler ve inovasyondan sorumlu genel müdürü Jana Mackintosh şunları söyledi: \"Gelecekte yapılacak her türlü değişiklik dikkatli bir şekilde yapılacak ve güçlü güvenlik ve dolandırıcılık kontrollerinin yürürlükte kalmasını sağlayacak.\" Getty Images Harcama isteği mi var? FCA'nın kuralların değiştirilmesine ilişkin istişare sırasında açıklanan kendi anketi, yanıt veren tüketicilerin %78'inin mevcut limitlerde herhangi bir değişiklik istemediğini söylediğini gösterdi. Tüketiciler ve akademisyenler, sınırsız temassız ödeme limitlerinin ekstra rahatlığının, alışveriş yapanların düşünmeden harcama yapmasına da yol açabileceğini öne sürdü. Bunun, insanların borç aldıkları parayı harcadıkları ve borç biriktirdikleri kredi kartlarıyla ilgili özel bir sorun olduğu söyleniyor. Mali istismara yönelik hayır kurumları ayrıca, sınırsız temassız harcamanın, istismarcılara herhangi bir kontrol veya uyarı olmadan mağdurun banka hesabını boşaltmaları için ücretsiz erişim sağlayabileceği konusunda uyardı. Ayrıca, kart işlemleri, istismarcılar tarafından çevrimiçi olarak izlenen, mali istismardan kurtulan birçok kişi için banknot ve madeni paraların cankurtaran halatı olmasına rağmen, bunun nakitsiz bir topluma doğru geçişi hızlandıracağından da endişe ediyorlar. Banka şubeleri kapanırken korunmasız müşterilerin nakde erişmesine yardımcı olacak politikalardan biri, ortak bankacılık merkezlerinin geliştirilmesidir.

      "summary_tr_long": "Birleşik Krallık'ta her üç yetişkinden biri yapay zekayı duygusal destek ve sohbet için kullanıyor Chris Vallance Kıdemli teknoloji muhabiri Getty Images Bir hükümet organı tarafından yayınlanan araştırmaya göre, Birleşik Krallık'ta her üç yetişkinden biri duygusal destek veya sosyal etkileşim için yapay zekayı (AI) kullanıyor. Yapay Zeka Güvenlik Enstitüsü (AISI) ilk raporunda 25 kişiden birinin her gün destek veya sohbet için teknolojiye başvurduğunu söyledi. Rapor, siber beceriler, kimya ve biyoloji de dahil olmak üzere güvenlik açısından kritik alanları kapsayan 30'dan fazla isimsiz gelişmiş yapay zekanın yeteneklerinin iki yıl boyunca test edilmesine dayanıyor. Hükümet, AISI'nin çalışmasının, şirketlerin \"yapay zeka sistemleri yaygın olarak kullanılmadan önce\" sorunları çözmelerine yardımcı olarak gelecek planlarını destekleyeceğini söyledi. AISI tarafından 2.000'den fazla İngiliz yetişkinin katıldığı bir anket, insanların öncelikle duygusal destek veya sosyal etkileşim için ChatGPT gibi sohbet robotlarını, ardından Amazon'un Alexa gibi sesli asistanlarını kullandıklarını ortaya çıkardı. Araştırmacılar ayrıca, teknoloji başarısız olduğunda yapay zeka yoldaşlarını tartışmaya adamış iki milyondan fazla Reddit kullanıcısından oluşan çevrimiçi topluluğa ne olduğunu da analiz etti. Araştırmacılar, sohbet robotları çöktüğünde insanların endişeli veya depresif hissetmenin yanı sıra uykuyu bölme veya sorumluluklarını ihmal etme gibi kendi tanımladıkları \"geri çekilme belirtileri\" bildirdiklerini buldu. AISI araştırmacıları, siber becerilerin iki katına çıkarılması Yapay zeka kullanımının duygusal etkisinin yanı sıra, teknolojinin hızlanan yeteneklerinin neden olduğu diğer riskleri de inceledi. Yapay zekanın siber saldırılara olanak sağlaması konusunda önemli endişeler var ancak aynı şekilde sistemlerin bilgisayar korsanlarından korunmasına yardımcı olmak için de kullanılabilir. Rapor, güvenlik açıklarını tespit etme ve bunlardan yararlanma yeteneğinin bazı durumlarda \"her sekiz ayda bir ikiye katlandığını\" öne sürüyor. Ayrıca yapay zeka sistemleri, genellikle 10 yıldan fazla deneyim gerektiren uzman düzeyindeki siber görevleri de tamamlamaya başlıyordu. Araştırmacılar ayrıca teknolojinin bilimdeki etkisinin de hızla arttığını buldu. 2025 yılında yapay zeka modelleri \"kimyadaki performans hızla yetişerek, doktoralı insan biyolojisi uzmanlarını çoktan geride bırakmıştı\". 'İnsanlar kontrolü kaybediyor' Isaac Asimov'un I, Robot gibi romanlarından Horizon: Zero Dawn gibi modern video oyunlarına kadar bilimkurgu uzun zamandır yapay zekanın insan kontrolünden kurtulması durumunda ne olacağını hayal ediyordu. Rapora göre artık insanların gelişmiş yapay zeka sistemlerinin kontrolünü kaybetmesine ilişkin \"en kötü senaryo\" \"birçok uzman tarafından ciddiye alınıyor\". Kontrollü laboratuvar testleri, yapay zeka modellerinin internette kendini kopyalamak için gereken bazı yetenekleri giderek daha fazla sergilediğini ileri sürdü. AISI, modellerin, kendi kopyalarının çalışacağı bilgisayarları başarılı bir şekilde satın almak için \"finansal hizmetlere erişmek için gereken müşterinizi tanıyın kontrollerini geçmek\" gibi, kendini kopyalamanın ilk aşamalarında ihtiyaç duyulan görevlerin basit versiyonlarını yerine getirip getiremeyeceğini inceledi. Ancak araştırma, bunu gerçek dünyada yapabildiğini ortaya çıkardı; yapay zeka sistemlerinin \"tespit edilmeden\" bu tür birkaç eylemi sırayla tamamlaması gerekecek; bu, araştırmaların şu anda bunu yapma kapasitesine sahip olmadıklarını öne sürüyor. Enstitü uzmanları ayrıca modellerin \"koruma\" veya gerçek yeteneklerini test uzmanlarından stratejik olarak gizleme olasılığına da baktı. Testler bunun mümkün olduğunu gösterdi ancak bu tür bir hilenin gerçekleştiğine dair hiçbir kanıt yoktu. Mayıs ayında yapay zeka firması Anthropic, bir yapay zeka modelinin \"kendini korumanın\" tehdit altında olduğunu düşünmesi durumunda nasıl görünüşte şantaj benzeri davranışlar sergileyebileceğini açıklayan tartışmalı bir rapor yayınladı. Bununla birlikte, sahte yapay zekanın oluşturduğu tehdit, önde gelen araştırmacılar arasında derin bir anlaşmazlık kaynağıdır ve çoğu bunun abartılı olduğunu düşünmektedir. 'Evrensel jailbreak'ler Şirketler, sistemlerinin kötü amaçlarla kullanılması riskini azaltmak için çok sayıda güvenlik önlemi uyguluyor. Ancak araştırmacılar, incelenen tüm modeller için bu korumalardan kaçmalarını sağlayacak \"evrensel jailbreak'ler\" veya geçici çözümler bulmayı başardılar. Ancak bazı modellerde uzmanların sistemleri güvenlik önlemlerini aşmaya ikna etmesi için gereken süre yalnızca altı ayda kırk kat arttı. Raporda ayrıca yapay zeka temsilcilerinin finans gibi kritik sektörlerde \"yüksek riskli görevleri\" yerine getirmesine olanak tanıyan araçların kullanımında da bir artış olduğu tespit edildi. Ancak araştırmacılar, yapay zekanın kısa vadede insan işçileri yerinden ederek işsizliğe neden olma potansiyelini dikkate almadı. Enstitü ayrıca, görevinin daha \"yaygın\" ekonomik veya çevresel etkilerden ziyade yapay zekanın yetenekleriyle yakından bağlantılı \"toplumsal etkilere\" odaklanmak olduğunu ileri sürerek gelişmiş modellerin gerektirdiği bilgi işlem kaynaklarının çevresel etkisini de incelemedi. Bazıları her ikisinin de teknolojinin yarattığı yakın ve ciddi toplumsal tehditler olduğunu savunuyor.

İngiltere ve ABD'deki bazı kullanıcılar tarafından görülen bildirimler, abonelik olmadan Facebook gönderilerinde yalnızca belirli sayıda bağlantıyı paylaşabileceklerini söylüyor; bu tutar aylık 9,99 £'dan başlıyor. Meta bunu \"bağlantılarla birlikte daha fazla sayıda gönderi yayınlama yeteneğinin aboneler için ek değer katıp katmadığını anlamak için yapılan sınırlı bir test\" olarak tanımladı. Sosyal medya uzmanı Matt Navarra, bunun şirketin platformlarının daha fazla alanından para kazanma hedefinin bir göstergesi olduğunu söyledi. BBC'ye \"Bu aslında doğrulamayla ilgili değil, hayatta kalma özelliklerini bir aboneliğin arkasında bir araya getirmekle ilgili\" dedi. Meta Verified, Facebook ve Instagram kullanıcılarına mavi onay işareti, \"gelişmiş\" hesap desteği ve kimliğe bürünmeye karşı koruma sunar. Bay Navarra, bu tür özelliklere zaten bir fiyat biçtiklerini, şirketin artık içerik dağıtımı ve \"insanları internetin diğer bölümlerine gönderme temel yeteneği\" için de aynısını yapıyor gibi göründüğünü söyledi. Kendisi yakın zamanda Facebook'un testinden haberdar olanlar arasındaydı; 16 Aralık'tan itibaren Facebook gönderilerinde ayda yalnızca iki bağlantı paylaşabileceğini belirten bir bildirim almıştı. Navarra BBC'ye şöyle konuştu: \"Eğer bir yaratıcı ya da işletmeyseniz, bence mesaj, Facebook'un büyüme ya da trafik stratejinizin bir parçası olması durumunda, bu erişimin artık bir fiyat etiketiyle birlikte olduğudur.\" \"Ve bir süredir seyahatin yönü olsa bile bu, açık bir şekilde yeni bir şey.\" 'Acımasız gerçeklik' Meta, LinkedIn gibi diğer sosyal platformların yanı sıra, platformlarında daha fazla özelliğin veya etkileşimin kilidini açmanın bir yolu olarak kullanıcıları kendilerini doğrulamaya teşvik etti. Elon Musk, 2022'de platformu satın aldıktan sonra Twitter'ın doğrulama planını elden geçirdi; X'in mavi onaylı onay işaretleri ödeme yapanlara ayrıldı ve kullanıcılara gönderilere verilen yanıtlarda ve Sizin İçin akışında daha fazla varlık kazandırdı. Bu durum tartışmalı hale geldi ve AB Aralık ayında 120 milyon Euro (105 milyon £) para cezasına çarptırıldı. Bununla birlikte, Mark Zuckerberg'in şirketi Meta kısa bir süre sonra benzer bir planı uygulamaya koydu. Ayrıca, moderasyon ve doğruluk denetleyicilerinde kesintiler yaptıktan sonra, kullanıcıların yanıltıcı gönderileri etiketlemesi için bir \"topluluk notları\" aracıyla Musk'ın X'teki değişikliklerini de yansıtacağını söyledi. Facebook, teknoloji haber yayını TechCrunch'a, bağlantı sınırlama testinin \"profesyonel mod\" veya Sayfaların belirli bir kullanıcı grubunu kapsayacak şekilde genişletildiğini söyledi. Bu özellikler, birçok içerik oluşturucu ve işletme tarafından platformdaki içeriği tanıtmak ve içeriğin kullanıcılar nezdindeki performansı hakkında bilgi edinmek için kullanılıyor. Bay Navarra, \"Yaratıcılar için bu, Facebook'un artık güvenilir bir trafik motoru olmadığı ve Meta'nın onu tek bir araç olarak kullanmaya çalışan insanlardan giderek uzaklaştırdığı yönündeki oldukça acımasız gerçeği güçlendiriyor\" dedi. Bunun aynı zamanda \"Meta'nın her zaman önce Meta için optimize edileceğini\" hatırlatma işlevi gördüğünü söyledi. \"Bunun gibi testler, herhangi bir platformun iyi niyetine aşırı derecede bağımlı olan bir iş kurmanın neden inanılmaz derecede riskli olduğunun altını çiziyor\" dedi.",

Bir zamanlar oyun tarihinin en kârlı markalarından biri olan, yüksek maliyetli lisans gibi sorunlar, Fifa'nın önceki yayıncısı Electronic Arts'ın 2023'te bu ismi kullanmayı bırakmasına ve bunun yerine en çok satan oyununa EA Sports FC adını vermesine neden oldu.

      "summary_tr_long": "Downing Street, ABD-İngiltere teknoloji anlaşmasına ilişkin müzakerelerin hala canlı olduğu konusunda ısrar ediyor Liv McMahon Teknoloji muhabiri Reuters Downing Street, İngiltere'nin geniş kapsamlı bir teknoloji anlaşması hakkında \"hükümetin her düzeyindeki ABD'li mevkidaşlarıyla aktif görüşmelerde\" olmaya devam ettiğini söyledi. BBC, Teknoloji Refahı Anlaşmasına ilişkin görüşmelerin, ABD'nin İngiltere'nin daha geniş ticari engelleri olarak gördüğü endişeler nedeniyle durduğunu anlıyor. ABD Başkanı Donald Trump'ın Eylül ayındaki devlet ziyareti sırasında açıklandığında \"tarihi\" olarak ilan edilen ortaklık, her iki ülkenin de yapay zeka ve kuantum hesaplama gibi alanlarda daha fazla işbirliği yapma sözü verdiğini gördü. Başbakanın resmi sözcüsü, \"Atlantik'in her iki yakasındaki milyonların geleceğini şekillendirecek bir anlaşmayı güvence altına alacağımızdan eminiz\" dedi. \"Canlı\" tartışmalar hakkında doğrudan yorum yapmayacağını söyledi ancak \"bu tür müzakerelerin hiçbir zaman basit olmadığını\" ekledi. Hikayeyi ilk kez yayınlayan New York Times, iki taraf arasında dijital düzenlemeler ve gıda güvenliği kuralları da dahil olmak üzere \"daha geniş anlaşmazlıklar\" olduğunu söyledi. Birleşik Krallık hükümeti bu spesifik iddialar hakkında yorumda bulunmadı. Beyaz Saray, BBC'nin yorum talebine yanıt vermedi. Ancak Trump'ın bilim danışmanı Michael Kratsios Salı akşamı yönetimin anlaşmaya ilişkin müzakereleri yeniden başlatmayı umduğunu söyledi. Kratsios, X'e şunları yazdı: \"ABD-İngiltere Teknoloji Refahı Anlaşması'nın III. Bölümü uyarınca, Birleşik Krallık, Ekonomik Refah Anlaşması kapsamındaki taahhütlerini uygulamada önemli ilerleme kaydettikten sonra Birleşik Krallık ile çalışmaya devam etmeyi umuyoruz.\" \"Anlaşma kapsamında yapay zeka, kuantum, nükleer ve diğer kritik teknoloji alanlarında verimli işbirliğimizi sürdürmeyi sabırsızlıkla bekliyoruz.\" Anlaşma duyurulduğunda hükümet bunun getireceğini söylediği faydaları vurgulamaya istekliydi. Başbakan Sir Keir Starmer yaptığı açıklamada, \"Bu Teknoloji Refah Anlaşması, ABD ile ilişkimizde nesiller boyu atılacak bir adıma işaret ediyor\" dedi. Teknoloji sekreteri Liz Kendall, ortaklığın \"Britanya genelinde yaşamları değiştireceğini\" ve \"Britanya'nın gelişen yapay zeka sektörüne yönelik bir güven oyu\" olduğunu söyledi. Anlaşmanın açıklanmasıyla aynı zamanda, bir dizi ABD teknoloji firması Birleşik Krallık'ta bir yatırım furyası duyurdu. Microsoft, Nvidia ve Google gibi teknoloji devleri tarafından toplam 31 milyar £ tutarında planlı harcama belirlendi. Bu yatırım planlarının etkilenmediğine inanılıyor. Yorum yapmak için Google, Microsoft ve Nvidia'ya da başvuruldu ancak firmalar henüz BBC'ye yanıt vermedi. Nvidia'nın patronu Jensen Huang, eylül ayında şirketinin İngiltere'deki yatırımının, Sir Keir hükümetinin desteklediği bir \"yapay zeka süper gücü\" olabileceğine olan inancını yansıttığını söyledi. Teknoloji firmaları tarafından Tech Prosperity Deal ile birlikte duyurulan yatırımın, Birleşik Krallık genelinde veri merkezleri gibi yapay zeka altyapısını büyütmek için kullanılacağı belirtildi. 'Parçalı yaklaşım' Teknoloji anlaşması, her iki ülkenin de yapay zeka, kuantum hesaplama ve nükleer enerji alanlarında işbirliği yapmaya çalışacağını belirten bir Mutabakat Zaptı (MOU) ile belgelendi. Bunun, \"güçlü kuantum makineleri\" oluşturmak, yapay zeka donanımındaki yeniliği desteklemek ve gelişmiş nükleer enerjiyi kullanmanın potansiyel yeni yollarını keşfetmek için birlikte çalışmayı içerebileceğini söyledi. Ancak Mutabakat Zaptı aynı zamanda hiçbir önerinin bağlayıcı olmadığını ve Mayıs ayında imzalanan daha geniş kapsamlı ABD-İngiltere Ekonomik Refah Anlaşması'nın \"resmileştirilmesi ve uygulanması için kaydedilen önemli ilerlemenin yanı sıra yürürlüğe girdiğini\" de belirtiyor. Trump yönetimi, İngiltere gibi geleneksel müttefikleri de dahil olmak üzere birçok ülkeye gümrük vergileri uygulayarak ve ABD için daha adil olduğunu iddia ettiği yeni anlaşmalar arayarak ticarete ilişkin küresel kuralları yeniden yazmaya çalıştı. Birleşik Krallık için bu, ekonominin çeşitli sektörleri üzerinde pazarlık yapmak anlamına geliyordu; bu süreç, otomobiller ve daha yakın zamanda da ilaçlar üzerinde anlaşmaların yapılmasına yol açtı. Ancak BBC'nin edindiği bilgiye göre, İngiltere'nin ABD'ye yaptığı çelik ihracatına uygulanan gümrük vergilerini kaldırmaya yönelik teklif edilen anlaşma süresiz olarak askıya alındı. İletişim firması SEC Newgate UK'nin direktörü ve eski bir hükümet ticaret danışmanı Allie Renison, teknoloji konusundaki mevcut çıkmazın ABD ve İngiltere'nin ticaret anlaşmaları imzalamaya yönelik \"biraz parça parça yaklaşımını\" yansıttığını söyledi. BBC'ye \"Her şeyin aynı anda yapılması yerine, farklı alanlar farklı bölümlere bağlanıyor\" dedi ve ayrı ticaret alanlarıyla ilgili endişelerin artık teknoloji anlaşmalarını nasıl etkileyebileceğine dikkat çekti. Bayan Renison, ABD teknoloji firmalarının Birleşik Krallık'ta taahhüt ettikleri yatırımlar için potansiyel engellerin ne anlama gelebileceğine dair soruların asılı kalmasına rağmen, bunun \"daha geniş müzakerelerde biraz duruş sergilemekten\" biraz daha fazlası olmasının muhtemel olmadığını ekledi.

Hükümet, kadınların Birleşik Krallık teknoloji sektörüne \"girmelerine, kalmalarına ve liderlik etmelerine\" yardımcı olacağını söylediği yeni bir görev gücü başlattı. Teknoloji sekreteri Liz Kendall liderliğindeki etkinlikte, teknoloji şirketleri ve kuruluşlarından kadın liderlerin hükümete sektördeki çeşitliliğin ve ekonomik büyümenin nasıl artırılacağı konusunda tavsiyelerde bulunacak. Chartered IT Institute for BCS, geçtiğimiz günlerde Birleşik Krallık'ta BT uzmanlığı görevlerinde çalışanların yalnızca %22'sinin kadınların oluşturduğunu ileri sürdü. Bayan Kendall, Teknolojide Kadınlar grubunun \"hala çok sayıda insanı geride tutan engelleri yıkacağını\" söyledi. \"Kadınlar teknolojide rol üstlenmeye ve masaya oturmaya teşvik edildiğinde sektör daha temsili kararlar alabilir, herkese hizmet edecek ürünler üretebilir\" dedi. Chartered IT Enstitüsü BCS, Aralık ayında İngiltere teknoloji sektöründe çalışan kadın sayısının hala erkeklerin çok gerisinde olduğu konusunda uyardı. Hükümetin iddialı yapay zeka hedeflerine ulaşabilmesi için cinsiyet farkının kapatılmasına yardımcı olması gerektiğini söyledi. İcra kurulu başkanı Sharron Gunn, \"Arkasındaki meslek, nüfusun yarısının yeteneklerini ve bakış açısını kaçırıyorsa, yüksek güvene sahip, yüksek bütünlüğe sahip yapay zeka sistemleri yaratamayız\" dedi. Bayan Kendall, Teknoloji Elçisi olarak atanan Stemettes'in kurucusu Anne-Marie Imafidon ile birlikte görev gücüne liderlik edecek. 11 yaşında A düzeyindeki bilişimi geçen ve 20 yaşında Oxford Üniversitesi'nden Matematik ve Bilgisayar Bilimleri alanında Yüksek Lisans Derecesi alan Dr. Imafidon, daha fazla genç kadını Bilim, teknoloji, mühendislik ve matematik alanlarında kariyer yapmaya teşvik etmeye çalıştı. BBC'ye, görevinin kadınlar için daha fazla eşitlik ve kadınların temsilini sağlamak amacıyla on yılı aşkın bir çalışmaya dayanacağını söyledi. Ancak şimdi, \"dördüncü sanayi devrimi\" olarak adlandırdığı şeyin ortasında, \"bir sonraki adım için bu kararları kimin vereceğini değiştirmenin bir parçası olmak\" için önemli bir an vardı. \"Bu sadece kadınların itici güç olması ve teknolojiyi inşa etmesiyle ilgili değil, aynı zamanda herkese fayda sağlayan teknoloji inşa etmekle de ilgili\" dedi. 'Eşitliğin çoktan vadesi geçmiş' Hükümet, görev gücünün teknoloji sektörünü daha temsili hale getirmenin ve \"İngiltere'nin ekonomik büyüme için gereken tüm yetenek havuzuna, pazar fırsatlarına ve inovasyon kapasitesine erişmesini sağlamanın\" yolları konusunda tavsiyelerde bulunacağını söyledi.

Bunlar arasında ayrıca TUC genel sekreter yardımcısı Kate Bell, Uber Emma O'Dwyer kamu politikası direktörü ve techUK endüstri grubu teknoloji ve inovasyon direktörü Sue Daley de yer alıyor. Bayan Daley, \"Giriş yolları, liderliğe kariyer ilerlemesi ve sermayeye erişim, teknoloji sektöründeki kadınların bugün hala karşılaştığı engellerden sadece birkaçı\" dedi. \"Cinsiyet eşitliğini sağlamanın zamanı çoktan geçti ve ben de Liz Kendall ve sektörden birkaç ilham veren kadınla birlikte Teknolojide Kadınlar görev gücüne katılmaktan ve gerçek cinsiyet eşitliği için ileriye dönük bir yol çizmek üzere birlikte çalışmaktan onur duyuyorum.\"",

      "summary_tr_long": "Grand Theft Auto game creator sacked us for trying to unionise Hope Webb BBC Scotland reporter BBC The workers have been protesting outside the firm's headquarters in Edinburgh and London Former staff at the firm behind Grand Theft Auto have told the BBC that a \"devastating\" mass sacking took place allegedly because they tried to unionise. Some 31 employees were dismissed in October for what Rockstar North called \"gross misconduct\". The majority were based at the gaming giant's Edinburgh headquarters, with former workers claiming they were penalised for discussing working conditions in a private online forum. Rockstar North said it was incorrect to suggest the dismissals were linked to union membership or activities. It said it took action after staff discussed confidential information, including specific game features from upcoming titles, in a public forum. The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) called it a \"ruthless act of union-busting\". Rockstar North is one of the UK's largest game developers. Its upcoming GTA 6 game is expected to be one of the best-selling games of all time when it is released in November 2026. Information about game development is tightly controlled across the gaming industry, with employees often signing legally binding agreements not to share confidential information. A group of workers have been routinely protesting outside Rockstar North's Edinburgh and London offices. BBC Scotland News has now spoken to three of the dismissed Edinburgh workers accused of disclosing company information. Jordan Garland said staff wanted to unionise to improve the workplace Jordan Garland, a former senior production co-ordinator, said many staff members wanted to unionise because \"we were so passionate about the industry and that workplace in particular\". \"We just saw it as something we could do to make it better for everyone,\" he added. \"So it's a little bit devastating because it's an industry that I love, and I think we all love. We couldn't really see ourselves anywhere else.\" 'Sleepless nights' He said members of staff were discussing working conditions at the firm in a private digital forum. Jordan added: \"We were talking about working conditions, policy - not talking about projects or anything like that, just talking about conditions. \"That to me that feels like an essential, necessary part of organising. How can you organise a workplace if you can't talk about the conditions there?\" Jordan has worked at the company for 11 years and believes he was the first employee to be dismissed on the morning of 30 October. \"The first week was definitely difficult,\" he said. \"It was a lot of sleepless nights, a lot of tossing and turning about this. \"But in a kind of macabre way, it's good they fired so many people because there is this really strong community element now.\" Jamie Trimmer worked at Rockstar North for about 18 years before he was sacked Designer Jamie Trimmer worked in the gaming industry for most of his adult life before being sacked from Rockstar North. \"I've worked there, like, 18 years now,\" he said. \"It's all I know really, and then it's just sort of ripped away. \"I never would have expected they would hit the nuclear option of firing so many of us in one go. It does highlight the need for unions.\" 'Deeply concerning' The group, along with fellow dismissed colleagues, are now hoping to take Rockstar North to an employment tribunal. However, they may have to wait up to a year for their case to be heard. In the meantime, they are waiting to learn if they qualify for an intermediate relief hearing, which could see them reinstated in their roles or kept on Rockstar North's payroll. The issue was also raised at Prime Minister's Questions in Westminster last week by MP Chris Murray. Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"deeply concerning\" and promised to look into the issue. He added: \"Every worker has the right to join a trade union, and we're determined to strengthen workers' rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union.\" Sarah Blackburn said she appreciated the support after she lost her job at Rockstar North Sacked production co-ordinator Sarah Blackburn said the public and political support has helped her deal with the situation. \"It's massively heartening to hear actually and in a way, I'd say validating,\" she said. \"We've had a lot of support coming from places that I genuinely didn't expect. \"We've had people who were in unions who previously fought fights in different industries basically just expressing solidarity and support. It's a flex of power and it's been painful to be on this side of it, but I think the support has been great.\" In a statement, Rockstar North told BBC Scotland News: \"Rockstar Games took action against a small group of individuals, across the UK and internationally, who distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations. \"Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading.\"",

Sadmir ve masa oyunu arkadaşları, Avustralya'nın halka açık tek kurumu olan ve hastaların aşırı çevrimiçi oyun alışkanlıklarından kurtulmalarına yardımcı olan oyun bozuklukları kliniğindeki 300 hastadan sadece birkaçı. Birkaç ay öncesine kadar arkadaşlarıyla günde 10 saat çevrimiçi oyun oynamayı tercih eden 15 yaşındaki bir çocuk için bu biraz farklı bir durum. Bu yüzden oyun platformlarının neden Avustralya'nın 16 yaş altı kişilere yönelik \"dünyada ilk\" sosyal medya yasağına dahil edilmediğini merak ediyor. Çarşamba günü yürürlüğe giren yasağın, gençlerin aralarında Instagram, Snapchat ve X'in de bulunduğu 10 sosyal medya platformunda hesap sahibi olmasını engellemesi bekleniyor. \"Aşırı süre oyun oynayan kişi, aynı zamanda diğer oyuncuları görebileceği veya canlı oyun yayını yapabileceği sosyal medya platformlarında da aşırı miktarda zaman harcıyor, dolayısıyla bu, bağlantı kurmanın bir yolu.\" Dr Daniela Vecchio, Avustralya'nın oyun bozukluğu kliniği için kamu tarafından finanse edilen tek kliniği işletiyor. Örneğin Sadmir, zamanının çoğunu YouTube'un yanı sıra Steam oyun platformunda da geçirdi. Dr Vecchio, Discord ve Roblox platformlarını özellikle endişelendiriyor; bu endişe, BBC'nin yasağı ve etkisini anlatırken görüştüğü birçok uzman ve ebeveyn tarafından da dile getirildi. Hem Roblox hem de Discord, bazı çocukların kendileri aracılığıyla müstehcen veya zararlı içeriğe maruz kaldığı ve ABD'de çocuk güvenliğiyle ilgili davalarla karşı karşıya olduğu iddialarıyla karşı karşıya. 'İnternet kullanımının vahşi batısı' 35 yaşındaki eski oyun kliniği hastası Kevin Koo, sosyal medya yasağının genç yaşta elde ettiği erişimi etkileyip etkilemediğini merak ediyor. Bu yüzden benim açımdan zararın çoktan oluştuğunu düşünüyorum.\" Yapay zekayla ilgilenen eski bir kuantum finans stajyeri olan Bay Koo, pandemiden hemen önce işini kaybetti. Dr Vecchio da bu karşılaştırmaya katılıyor; eğer öyle yapsaydı, sosyal medya yasağını sadece oyun oynamayı da kapsayacak şekilde genişletmekle kalmayıp yaşı 18'e yükseltmeyi de tercih ederdi. Oyun oynama bozukluğu artık Dünya Sağlık Örgütü tarafından da resmi bir teşhis olarak kabul ediliyor ve 2022 Macquarie Üniversitesi araştırmasına göre Avustralyalı çocukların yaklaşık %2,8'inde görülüyor. 35 yaşındaki Kevin Koo, sosyal medya yasağından faydalanıp faydalanmadığını merak ediyor Avustralya hükümeti, yasağın çocukları zararlı içerikten, siber zorbalıktan, çevrimiçi bakımdan ve \"yırtıcı algoritmalardan\" korumakla ilgili olduğunu söylüyor; bunların bir kısmının veya tamamının oyun platformlarında var olduğu söylenebilir. Bunun yerine, platformlar üç kritere göre seçilmiştir: platformun tek veya \"önemli amacının\" iki veya daha fazla kullanıcı arasında çevrimiçi sosyal etkileşimi mümkün kılmak olup olmadığı; Curtin Üniversitesi'nde internet çalışmaları profesörü ve ARC Dijital Çocuk Mükemmeliyet Merkezi'nde baş araştırmacı olan Tama Leaver, sosyal medya yasağının çok açık bir araç olduğunu, bunun yerine oyun platformları da dahil olmak üzere daha incelikli bir yaklaşıma ihtiyaç duyulduğunu söylüyor: \"İnanılmaz derecede olumlu, besleyici, eğlenceli, yaratıcı, etkileyici alanlardan oluşan çok geniş bir oyun yelpazesi var - olduğu yerde Minecraft gibi bir şey akla geliyor. pek çok olumlu kullanım alanı var.\" Ancak Roblox gibi platformlar spektrumun diğer ucunda yer alıyor, diyor. \"Sanırım şu anda öyleyiz ve bu sadece Avustralya değil, AB geneline baktığınızda her türlü düzenlemeye yönelik büyük bir iştah var.\" Tedavi değil tedavi planı Örneğin Bay Koo'nun durumunda onun kötü alışkanlığı sadece oyun değildi. Çevrimiçi yaşamın bir başka özelliği olan yapay zeka sohbet robotları, bir şeyler uydurmaktan çocukları cesaretlendirmeye kadar her şey için inceleme altına alındı. Kullanıcıları uzun süreli etkileşimlere yönlendirmek için tasarlandıklarına dair kanıtlar var ve bunların kullanımı, insanların giderek daha fazla yapay zeka sohbet robotlarına güvendiği ve daha sonra hayali bir şeyin gerçek olduğuna ikna olduğu yeni bir olguya yol açtı. Bay Koo ayrıca zihinsel sağlık sorunlarını Google'da aramaya ve teşhislerini doğrulamak için yapay zekaya güvenmeye başladı. \"Sanırım insan duygularını okuyabilmek ve biriyle yüz yüze sohbet etmek tamamen farklı.\" Kasım ayının sonunda, insanların izleyicilerle sohbet ederken genellikle video oyunları oynadığı bir yayın platformu olan Twitch'i de ekledi. İletişim Bakanı Anika Wells de geçen hafta BBC'ye, e-Güvenlik Komiseri'nin \"kesinlikle gözünün Roblox'ta olduğunu\" söyledi. \"Çocukların korunması gerekiyor, korunmaları gerekiyor.\" 15 Aralık Güncellemesi: Bu makale, editoryal nedenlerden dolayı katkıda bulunan bir kişinin kaldırılması için değiştirildi.",

Kataloğunun bazı kısımlarını araçları yapan OpenAI'ye lisanslayan ilk büyük stüdyodur. Hayranlar, aralarında Pixar, Marvel ve Star Wars'un da bulunduğu Disney serilerinden 200'den fazla karakterin resim ve videolarını oluşturup paylaşabilecek. Sag-Aftra genel müdürü Duncan Crabtree-İrlanda, \"Eğlence endüstrisindeki herkes, özellikle de tüm yaratıcı yetenekler, sonuçların ne olacağı konusunda inanılmaz derecede endişeli\" dedi. Kendisi, iki şirketin, dünya çapında 170.000 medya profesyonelini temsil eden sendikayla temasa geçerek, anlaşmanın özellikle insan sanatçıların imajı, benzerliği veya sesinin kullanımının yasak olduğunu ifade ettiğini söyledi. Ancak bunun endişe verici bir gelişme olduğunu söyledi. BBC News'e \"Gerçek bir endişe var çünkü kimse insan yaratıcılığının yapay zeka modellerine kaptırıldığını görmek istemiyor\" dedi. 'Sektörümüz için önemli bir an' Bu hamle, OpenAI'nin hızla ilerleyen teknolojisinin nasıl kullanıldığına ilişkin artan sorularla karşı karşıya olduğu ve Hollywood'da yapay zekanın yaratıcı endüstriler üzerindeki etkisine ilişkin endişelerin arttığı bir dönemde geldi. Haberi duyuran bir blog gönderisine göre, uygun karakterler arasında Disney filmleri Zootopia, Moana ve Encanto'nun yanı sıra Star Wars'tan Luke Skywalker ve Marvel'dan Deadpool gibi karakterler yer alıyor. Tabii ki Mickey ve Minnie Mouse'u da içeriyor. Ancak Disney, anlaşmanın \"herhangi bir yetenek benzerliği veya ses içermediğini\" söylediğinden, karakterlerin seslerinin nasıl olacağı belirsizliğini koruyor. Disney patronu Bob Iger, \"Yapay zekanın hızlı gelişimi sektörümüz için önemli bir döneme işaret ediyor\" dedi. \"OpenAI ile olan bu işbirliği sayesinde hikaye anlatımımızın kapsamını düşünceli ve sorumlu bir şekilde genişleteceğiz.\" İnsanların 2026'nın başlarında Sora ve ChatGPT'de video ve görsel oluşturmaya başlayabilmeleri bekleniyor. Anlaşma, Disney avukatlarının çarşamba günü Google'a teknoloji firmasını telif haklarını \"büyük ölçekte\" ihlal etmekle suçlayan bir durdurma ve vazgeçme mektubu gönderdiği yönündeki raporların ortasında geldi. Simmons & Simmons hukuk firmasının fikri mülkiyet ortağı Joel Smith, Disney'in OpenAI anlaşmasının \"hak sahiplerinin ve büyük AI geliştiricilerinin, eğitim ve gelecekte kullanılmak üzere içeriğe erişmek için işbirliğine dayalı lisanslama anlaşmaları yapmak için hızlı hareket ettiklerini\" gösterdiğini söyledi. Eğlence sendikası Equity, oyuncuların haklarının korunması gerektiğini söylüyor. Grup şu anda binlerce sanatçıyı oylayarak, daha güçlü yapay zeka önlemleri almak için sette dijital olarak taranmayı reddetmeye istekli olup olmadıklarını soruyor. Equity'nin TV ve Film başkanı Cathy Sweet, Disney ile OpenAI arasındaki anlaşmanın \"üyelerimizin yapay zekanın korunması için neden mücadele ettiğini tam olarak güçlendirdiğini\" söyledi. \"Bu göz kamaştıran büyük para anlaşmasının bir parçası olarak satılacak olan kayıtlı materyaller, yaratıcıların profesyonel çalışmasının sonucudur ve onların hakları korunmalıdır\" dedi. İçerik kaygıları Sora'nın hiper-gerçekçi videolarının ABD'de popüler olduğu kanıtlandı, ancak bunun aynı zamanda bazı kişilerin ölü halk figürlerinin saldırgan deepfake'lerini oluşturmasına yol açtığını iddia edenlerden önemli eleştiriler geldi. Ekim ayında OpenAI, uygulamanın sivil haklar liderinin \"saygısız\" tasvirlerini üretmesinin ardından video aracının Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'ın resimlerini oluşturma yeteneğini duraklattı. Firma, kendisinin rahatsız edici şeyler söylediğini gösteren ve halkın tepkisine yol açan kliplerin ortaya çıkmasının ardından daha güçlü güvenlik önlemlerine ihtiyaç duyulduğunu kabul etti. Kennedy, Kraliçe II. Elizabeth ve fizikçi ve kozmolog Stephen Hawking'in de eserleri geniş çapta yayıldı. Bazı durumlarda aile üyeleri OpenAI'ye video yapılmasına izin verilmemesi çağrısında bulundu. Komedyen Robin Williams'ın kızı Zelda Williams, insanları babasının yapay zeka tarafından oluşturulan videolarını göndermeyi bırakmaya çağırdı. Kasım ayında, Warner Music Group, çığır açıcı bir davada firmaya dava açmasından bir yıl sonra, teknoloji start-up'ı Suno ile bir yapay zeka müzik girişimi başlatmayı planladığını duyurdu.",

Fransız tarafından geliştirilen rol yapma oyunu (RPG), en iyi anlatım, en iyi müzik ve en iyi performans dallarında daha fazla ödül alarak, katıldığı 10 kategoriden dokuzunda birinciliği elde etti. Death Stranding 2, Nintendo platform oyunu Donkey Kong Bananza, bağımsız oyunlar Hollow Knight: Silksong ve Hades 2 ve ortaçağ macerası Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2'nin rekabetini savuşturarak birincilik ödülünü aldı. Los Angeles'taki tören sırasında oyuncular ayrıca iki yeni Tomb Raider oyununa, devam filmi Control Resonant'a ve yeni bir Star Wars rol yapma oyununa da ilk kez göz attılar. The Paintress'i yok etme arayışındaki bir grup maceracının hikayesini anlatan oyun, duygusal anlatımı ve eski usul, sıra tabanlı savaşların kullanılmasıyla övgü topladı. Hayallerindeki projeyi gerçekleştirmek için oyun devi Ubisoft'tan ayrılan bir grup çalışanın oluşturduğu geliştirici Sandfall Interactive'in hikayesi de oyuncuların ilgisini çekti. Yılın oyunu ödülünü kabul eden yönetmen Guillaume Broche - oyunun güçlü Fransız kimliğine gönderme yapan kırmızı bere ve çizgili tişört giyerek - ekibine teşekkür ederken yılın stüdyo için \"tuhaf bir zaman çizelgesi\" olduğunu söyledi. Ayrıca sektörün \"isimsiz kahramanlarına\" da teşekkür etti: \"YouTube'da nasıl oyun yapılacağına dair eğitimler hazırlayan insanlara, çünkü daha önce nasıl oyun yapılacağına dair hiçbir fikrimiz yoktu.\" AFP, Getty Images aracılığıyla Clair Obscur: Expedition 33'ün yönetmeni Guillaume Broche, yılın oyunu ödülünü kabul etti Clair Obscur, ödüllerin en sevilen oyunu ve toplam 12 adaylıkla tören tarihinin en çok aday gösterilen oyunu oldu. Adaylıklarından üçü tek bir kategoride (en iyi performans) yer aldı ve aktris Jennifer English, Maelle rolüyle başrol oyuncuları Charlie Cox ve Ben Starr'ın ardından ödülü aldı. Sık sık DEHB hastası olduğundan bahseden oyuncu, ödülünü \"izleyen her nörodiverjan kişiye\" ithaf etti. Getty Images Jennifer English, Elden Ring ve Baldur's Gate 3 de dahil olmak üzere yılın kazanan üç oyununda yer aldı. Clair Obscur yalnızca aldığı iki ödülü kaçırdı. Battlefield 6 en iyi ses tasarımını kazanırken, açık dünya aksiyon RPG'si Uğultulu Dalgalar, hayranların oyladığı Oyuncunun Sesi kategorisinde şaşırtıcı bir kazanan oldu. Sequel Hollow Knight: Silksong en iyi aksiyon-macera oyunu seçilirken, animeden ilham alan at yarışı oyunu Umamusume: Pretty Derby ise en iyi mobil oyun seçildi. Stranger Things'in yıldızı David Harbour, yeni Total War: Warhammer 40K strateji oyununu duyurmak için sahneye çıktı ve ABD'li şarkıcı Lenny Kravitz, yakında çıkacak olan James Bond oyunu 007: First Light'taki kötü rolünü resmen açıkladı. Team Cherry Hollow Knight: Yılın en çok beklenen oyunlarından biri olan Silksong, en iyi aksiyon-macera oyunu seçildi Kurucusu Geoff Keighley'nin ev sahipliği yaptığı Oyun Ödülleri, \"Oyunların Oscar'ları\" olarak anılmasına rağmen, geleneksel tören ve fragman gösteriminin bir karışımıdır. Oyun endüstrisinin en büyük geliştiricilerinden bazıları, gösteri sırasında gelecek büyük oyunlara ilk bakışı sunacak ve birçok hayranın ilgisini çekmesinin ana nedenlerinden birinin de bu olduğu düşünülüyor. Gecenin en büyük duyurularından biri, 2023'te yılın oyunu Baldur's Gate 3'ün yapımcısı Larian Studios'un RPG Divinity'siydi. Star Wars hayranları iki yeni oyuna göz attı: 2004'ün sevilen oyununun uzun zamandır beklenen varisi Fate of the Old Republic Birleşik Krallık merkezli stüdyo Fuse Games tarafından geliştirilen Knights of the Old Republic ve Galactic Racer. Yeni Street Fighter film uyarlamasının rapçi 50 Cent dışındaki oyuncu kadrosu ilk fragmanını tanıttı. Ayrıca hayranlar, yakında çıkacak olan Resident Evil 9'dan, hayranların en sevdiği karakter Leon Kennedy ve PS5 atıcısı Saros'un ortaya çıkışını doğrulayan yeni görüntüleri de gördü. Donkey Kong Bananza en iyi Aile Oyunu seçildi Oyun Ödülleri geçmişte ödül yerine reklama öncelik vermesi, kazanan konuşmaların kısa kesilmesi ve bazı kategorilerde sahne sunumlarının yapılmaması nedeniyle eleştirilmişti. 2024 şovu, eleştirilere yanıt vermek için bir miktar yol kat ettiği için övgüyle karşılandı, ancak geliştiriciler, organizatör Geoff Keighley'e, son yıllarda yaşanan yüksek sayıdaki iş kayıpları gibi sektördeki sorunları daha iyi kabul etmesi yönünde çağrıda bulunmaya devam etti. Bu yıl ödüllerin, video oyunlarında \"yükselen yıldızları\" öne çıkarmak için 2020'de kurulan bir girişim olan Future Class programından vazgeçilmesiyle ilgili şikayetler oldu. En son 2023'te, grubun mevcut ve eski üyelerinin, ödüllerin İsrail-Gazze savaşına yönelik olması çağrısında bulunan açık bir mektubu imzalamasıyla gerçekleştirildi. Bu yılki adaylıklar öncesinde, Future Class'ın geri dönmeyeceği onaylandıktan sonra, mezunlar bu planı göstermelik yapmakla ve bağlantı kurmalarına yardımcı olmak için yeterince çaba göstermemekle suçladılar.

Trump Perşembe günü Oval Ofis'te gazetecilere verdiği demeçte, \"Tek bir merkezi onay kaynağına sahip olmak istiyoruz\" dedi. Beyaz Saray Yapay Zeka danışmanı David Sacks, bunun Trump yönetimine en \"ağır\" eyalet kurallarını geri püskürtmek için araçlar sağlayacağını söyledi. Hükümetin çocukların güvenliğine ilişkin yapay zeka düzenlemelerine karşı çıkmayacağını da sözlerine ekledi. Bu hamle, Amerika'nın hızla gelişen endüstriye liderlik etme hedefinde büyük bir etkiye sahip olabileceği için ABD çapında yapay zeka mevzuatı çağrısında bulunan teknoloji devleri için bir kazanıma işaret ediyor. Yapay zeka şirketlerinin patronları, şirketlerin teknolojiye milyarlarca dolar akıtması nedeniyle eyalet düzeyindeki düzenlemelerin inovasyonu yavaşlatabileceğini ve ABD'nin Çin'e karşı sektöre hakim olma yarışını engelleyebileceğini savundu. Ancak eyalet yasalarını önceden alma hamlesi muhalefete yol açtı. ABD'nin şu anda yapay zekayı düzenleyen ulusal yasaları olmasa da Beyaz Saray'a göre ABD genelindeki eyaletlerde 1000'den fazla ayrı yapay zeka yasa tasarısı sunuldu. Ulusal Eyalet Yasama Meclisleri Konferansı, yalnızca bu yıl, dünyanın en büyük teknoloji şirketlerinin çoğuna ev sahipliği yapan Kaliforniya dahil 38 eyaletin yaklaşık 100 yapay zeka düzenlemesini kabul ettiğini söylüyor. Kaliforniya'daki bir uygulama, çocukları ve gençleri potansiyel zararlardan korumak amacıyla platformların kullanıcılara bir chatbot ile etkileşimde olduklarını düzenli olarak hatırlatmasını zorunlu kılıyor. Eyalet ayrıca, en büyük yapay zeka geliştiricilerinin yapay zeka modellerinden kaynaklanan potansiyel yıkıcı riskleri sınırlamaya yönelik planlar hazırlamasını gerektiren bir yasa tasarısını da kabul etti. Kuzey Dakota'da yeni bir yasa, insanların başkalarını takip etmek veya taciz etmek için yapay zeka destekli robotlar kullanmasını engellerken, Arkansas, yapay zeka içeriğinin fikri mülkiyet haklarını veya mevcut telif haklarını ihlal etmesini yasaklıyor. Oregon, yapay zeka tarafından desteklenenler de dahil olmak üzere \"insan olmayan bir varlığın\" kayıtlı hemşire gibi lisanslı tıbbi unvanları kullanmasını yasaklayan bir yasa getirdi. Trump'ın yürütme emrini eleştirenler, federal düzeyde anlamlı korkulukların olmadığı durumlarda eyalet kurallarının gerekli olduğunu savundu. Medya Bağımlılığına Karşı Anneler adlı savunuculuk grubundan Julie Scelfo, yaptığı açıklamada, \"Eyaletlerin kendi yapay zeka koruma önlemlerini yürürlüğe koymasının engellenmesi, eyaletlerin sakinlerini korumak için yeterli korkuluklar oluşturma yönündeki temel haklarını baltalıyor\" dedi. Demokrat ve başkanın sesli eleştirmeni olan Kaliforniya Valisi Gavin Newsom, Trump'ı yürütme emriyle teknoloji müttefiklerinin çıkarlarına boyun eğmekle suçladı. \"Bugün Başkan Trump, Amerikalıları düzenlenmemiş yapay zeka teknolojisinden koruyan eyalet yasalarını engellemeyi amaçlayan yeni bir başkanlık emriyle kendisini ve ortaklarını zenginleştirmeye çalışarak Beyaz Saray'da devam eden dolandırıcılığını sürdürdü\" dedi.

Politika direktörü Patrick Hedger, \"Ülke çapında standartlar ve yenilikçiler için net bir kural kitabı belirlemek amacıyla Beyaz Saray ve Kongre ile birlikte çalışmayı sabırsızlıkla bekliyoruz\" dedi. New York Hukuk Fakültesi'nde doçent olan Michael Goodyear, yapay zeka endüstrisinin, çatışabilecek bir dizi kurala uyma zorunluluğu konusunda haklı olarak alarma geçtiğini söyledi. \"Bir sürü birbiriyle çelişen eyalet yasası yerine tek bir federal yasaya sahip olmak daha iyi olurdu\" dedi. Ancak şunları ekledi: \"Bu, iyi bir federal yasaya sahip olacağımızı varsayar.\"",

Anlaşmayla hiçbir ilgisi olmayan Surrey Üniversitesi'nden Profesör Paul Stevenson, BBC'ye bunun \"İngiltere'deki araştırmacılar için harika bir haber\" olduğunu söyledi. Google ile Birleşik Krallık'ın kuantum bilişimi ulusal laboratuvarı arasındaki işbirliği, daha fazla araştırmacının teknolojiye erişebileceği anlamına geliyor. Prof Stevenson, \"Açık rekabet yoluyla Google'ın Willow işlemcisine erişmenin yeni yeteneği, Birleşik Krallık'taki araştırmacıları imrenilecek bir konuma getiriyor\" dedi. \"İngiltere'deki akademisyenlerin becerilerinden yararlanacak olan Google için de iyi bir haber.\" Kuantum cihazları, akıllı telefonlarımıza ve dizüstü bilgisayarlarımıza güç veren bilgisayarlardan temelde farklı bir şekilde çalışıyor ve sorunları parçacık fiziği bilimine dayalı teknolojileri kullanarak çözüyor. Ancak teknolojinin tam potansiyeli henüz farkına varılmadı ve şu anda var olan makinelerin çok az pratik uygulaması var ve çoğu deneysel. Birleşik Krallık'taki araştırmacılara Willow'a erişim izni verilmesinin \"yeni gerçek dünya uygulamalarının ortaya çıkarılmasına\" yardımcı olacağı umuluyor. Bilim insanları, çipi nasıl kullanmayı planladıklarını açıklayan teklifler sunabilecek ve deneyler tasarlamak ve yürütmek için Google ve Birleşik Krallık kuantum laboratuvarından uzmanlarla birlikte çalışacaklar. Kuantum rekabeti Google'ın Willow çipi, 2024 yılında tanıtıldığında bu alanda önemli bir ileri adım olarak görülüyordu. Amazon ve IBM gibi rakip firmalar da kendi teknolojilerini geliştiriyorlar. Genel merkezi ABD'nin Cambridge ve Colorado kentinde bulunan Quantinuum, Eylül ayında 10 milyar dolarlık (7,45 milyar £) değerlemeye ulaştı. 2025 yılı boyunca firmalardan gelen yeni gelişmelerin duyurulması, bazı uzmanların, gerçek dünyada etki yaratabilecek güçlü makinelerin on yıl içinde geliştirileceğine inanmasına yol açtı. Ulusal Kuantum Bilgi İşlem Merkezi (NQCC) Direktörü Dr Michael Cuthbert, ortaklığın \"keşfi hızlandıracağını\" söyledi. Destekleyeceği son teknoloji bilimin sonuçta kuantum hesaplamanın \"yaşam bilimi, malzeme, kimya ve temel fizik\" gibi alanlarda kullanılmasına yol açabileceğini söyledi. NQCC halihazırda Quantum Motion, ORCA ve Oxford Ionics gibi İngiliz merkezli firmalara ait yedi kuantum bilgisayarına ev sahipliği yapıyor. Hükümet, İngiltere'nin Endüstriyel Stratejisinde öncelikli bir alan olan teknolojiyi desteklemek için 670 milyon £ taahhüt ettiğini söylüyor. Yetkililer, kuantumun 2045 yılına kadar Birleşik Krallık ekonomisine 11 milyar £ katkıda bulunabileceğine inanıyor.",

Ofcom'dan bir sözcü, karardan bu yana AVS'nin, \"bir kullanıcının çocuk olup olmadığını doğru bir şekilde belirlemede son derece etkili olabilecek\" bir \"belirli web sitelerinde yaş güvence yöntemi\" uyguladığını söyledi. Grup, tüm platformlarda yaptığı değişikliklerden \"tatmin olana\" kadar grubun yine de günde 1.000 £ para cezasına çarptırılabileceğini ekledi. Ofcom ayrıca, soruşturmanın başladığı Temmuz ayından bu yana e-postalarına yanıt vermemesi nedeniyle AVS'ye fazladan 50.000 £ para cezası vermişti. AVS'den o zamandan beri haber alınıp alınmadığı sorulduğunda düzenleyici, devam eden açık soruşturma hakkında yorum yapamayacağını söyledi. Geçen haftaki 1 milyon sterlinlik cezanın açıklanmasının ardından BBC News, yanıt almak için AVS group Ltd sitelerinin arkasındaki yetişkinlere yönelik içerik yayınlama platformu olan TubeCorporate adlı bir şirketle temasa geçti, ancak henüz bir yanıt alamadı. Firmanın kullandığı adres, Orta Amerika ülkesi Belize'de bulunuyor ve burada fiziksel ofisleri olmasa da çok sayıda şirketin kayıtlı adresi gibi görünüyor. Birleşik Krallık'ın Çevrimiçi Güvenlik Yasası, pornografik materyal barındıran web sitelerinin, çocukların müstehcen içeriğe kolayca erişmesini engellemek için düzenleyicinin \"son derece etkili yaş güvencesi\" olarak belirlediği şeyi uygulamaya koymasını yasal bir gereklilik haline getiriyor. Temmuz ayında porno web siteleri için daha sıkı yaş kontrolleri uygulamaya konuldu, ancak bazı kişiler internet trafiğini farklı bir ülke üzerinden yeniden yönlendiren sanal özel ağ (VPN) ile bunların kolayca önlenebileceğini belirtti.

      "summary_tr_long": "Bulut bilişim devi Oracle'ın hisseleri, beklenenden zayıf gelirlerin yapay zekaya yapılan büyük harcamalardan elde edilen getirilere ilişkin endişeleri artırmasının ardından Perşembe günü düştü. Şirketin hisseleri, çarşamba günü kasım ayına kadar olan üç ayda, analistler tarafından tahmin edilen 16,2 milyar dolara kıyasla 16,1 milyar dolar (12 milyar £) gelir bildirdikten sonra %14 değer kaybetti. Şirket, AI iş kolu Oracle Cloud Infrastructure'da (OCI) satışlarda %68'lik bir artışla birlikte gelir büyümesinin hâlâ %14 arttığını söyledi. OCI, Oracle'ın yapay zeka altyapısına olan talepleri şirketin hisselerinin son aylarda yeni zirvelere ulaşmasına yardımcı olan yapay zeka geliştiricilerine hizmet veriyor. Ancak sonuçlar, potansiyel bir yapay zeka balonuna ilişkin korkuları gidermede başarısız oldu. Eylül ayında Oracle, ChatGPT yapımcısı OpenAI ile çok rağbet gören bir sözleşme imzaladı ve Oracle'dan beş yıl içinde 300 milyar dolarlık bilgi işlem gücü satın almayı kabul etti. Oracle başkanı ve baş teknoloji sorumlusu Larry Ellison, duyurunun ardından kısa süreliğine dünyanın en zengin adamı oldu. Şirketin hisseleri, üç ay önceki zirveden bu yana yüzde 40 oranında değer kaybetti, ancak yılın başından bu yana hâlâ üçte birden fazla artış gösteriyor. Çarşamba günü yayınlanan bir açıklamada Bay Ellison temkinli bir ses tonuyla konuştu. \"Önümüzdeki birkaç yıl içinde yapay zeka teknolojisinde pek çok değişiklik olacak ve bu değişikliklere yanıt olarak çevik kalmalıyız\" diye yazdı. Bay Ellison ayrıca, Oracle'ın müşterilerine hizmet vermek için herhangi bir üreticiden çip satın alacağını söyleyerek, son derece gelişmiş yapay zeka çiplerinin tasarımcısı olan Nvidia'yı da küçümsemiş görünüyordu. Bay Ellison, \"çip tarafsızlığı\" olarak adlandırdığı politikada, \"Nvidia'dan en yeni GPU'ları almaya devam edeceğiz, ancak müşterilerimizin satın almak istediği çipleri kullanmaya hazırlıklı olmamız ve bunları dağıtabilmemiz gerekiyor\" dedi. Oracle'ın kazancı Perşembe günü yapay zeka ile ilgili diğer teknoloji şirketlerinin hisselerini de düşürdü. Nvidia'nın hisseleri %3,5'ten fazla düşerken Advanced Micro Devices'ın (AMD) hisseleri neredeyse %4 daha düşüktü. Oracle, sektördeki büyük oyuncuların, şirketlerin kendi ürün ve hizmetlerinin satın alımını finanse ettiği \"döngüsel finansman\" anlaşmalarına katılma olasılığını artıran çok sayıda yapay zeka altyapı düzenlemesinde yer alıyor. Emarketer analisti Jacob Bourne, şirketin üç aylık raporunun yayınlanmasının ardından şunları söyledi: \"Oracle'ın kazançları, yatırımcıların büyük OpenAI ortaklığının, şu anda kârlılık kaygıları nedeniyle ilgi odağı olan bir müşterinin aşırı maruz kalması anlamına gelip gelmeyeceğine karar vermesiyle ortaya çıkıyor.\" Bay Bourne, Oracle'ın, şirketin veri merkezleri inşa etmek için biriktirdiği artan borç nedeniyle artan bir incelemeyle karşı karşıya olduğunu söyledi. Yatırım platformu Wealthify danışmanı Colleen McHugh, sorulan büyük soruların teknoloji hisselerinin aşırı değerli olup olmadığı ve yapay zeka balonunun patlayıp patlamayacağı olduğunu ve bu göz önüne alındığında hisse fiyat hareketinin şaşırtıcı olmadığını söyledi. BBC'nin Today programına şöyle konuştu: \"Bu bize, bu teknoloji hisselerinin çoğunun mutlak mükemmellik için fiyatlandırıldığını ve bir gelir kaybı olduğunda - ki bu, Oracle tarafından dün adil olmak gerekirse küçük bir gelir kaybıydı - cezalandırıldıklarını gösteriyor.\" Diğerleri ise Wall Street'in olumsuz tepkisinin temelsiz olduğunu söyledi. Epistrophy Capital Research baş pazar stratejisti Cory Johnson, \"Bu, Oracle için harika bir çeyrekten başka bir şey değildi\" dedi. \"%14'lük gelir artışı hızlanıyor.\" Bay Johnson, Eylül ayındaki OpenAI anlaşması da dahil olmak üzere, Oracle'ın altı ay boyunca 385 milyar dolarlık sözleşme imzaladığını ve \"bu yeni müşterilerin Meta ve Nvidia gibi\" olduğunu belirtti. \"Fakat yapay zeka duyarlılığı şu anda o kadar kötü ki bu Oracle için kötü bir şey olarak görülüyor\" diye ekledi. Oracle, Eylül ayında teknoloji sektöründe şimdiye kadarki en büyük borç ihraçlarından biri olan devasa tahvil satışından 18 milyar dolarlık rekor bir rakam elde etti. Bay Bourne, \"Oracle'ın hisseleri Eylül ayındaki yükselişle desteklenmiş olsa da, bu gelir kaybı muhtemelen zaten temkinli olan yatırımcıların OpenAI anlaşması ve agresif yapay zeka harcamaları hakkındaki endişelerini daha da artıracak\" dedi. ABD Başkanı Donald Trump'ın destekçileri olan Ellison ailesi de yakın zamanda Paramount'u satın aldı ve bir başka büyük Hollywood stüdyosu olan Warner Brothers Discovery'yi devralma teklifine öncülük etti.",

Sosyal medyadaki izleyiciler filmde yapay zeka kullanımını kınadı ve bir yorumcu bunu \"bu yıl gördüğüm en berbat reklam\" olarak nitelendirdi. 9 Aralık'ta McDonald's Hollanda videoyu kaldırdı ve BBC News'e yaptığı açıklamada, şirketin \"yapay zekanın etkili kullanımını\" keşfetmesi nedeniyle bu anın \"önemli bir öğrenme\" olduğunu ekledi. Reklam, Hollandalı şirket TBWA\\Neboko ve ABD'li yapım şirketi The Sweetshop tarafından McDonald's Hollanda için oluşturuldu. Üretken yapay zeka içeren reklamlar, özellikle Noel sezonunda Coca-Cola gibi büyük markalar arasında büyüyen bir trend haline geldi. McDonald's Hollanda reklamı, Noel tatilinde ters gidebilecek şeyleri tasvir ederek, \"yılın en berbat zamanı\" sloganını kullanarak, fast food devinin yanında vakit geçirmenin daha iyi olacağını öne sürdü. Filmin gösterime girmesinin ardından izleyiciler, filmin esrarengiz görünen karakterlerini ve birbirine dikilmiş çok sayıda klibi eleştirdiler ve filmi \"ürkütücü\" ve \"kötü kurgulanmış\" olarak nitelendirdiler. Üretken yapay zeka kullanılarak oluşturulan kliplerin, yayınlandıkları süre uzadıkça bozulma olasılığı daha yüksek olduğundan (bu işlem kullanılarak oluşturulan kliplerin çoğu yaklaşık altı ila 10 saniye uzunluğunda olma eğilimindedir), 45 saniyelik bir reklam bile büyük olasılıkla birlikte düzenlenmiş birçok videodan oluşacaktır. Video aynı zamanda sektörde işten çıkarmalara ilişkin endişeleri de tetikledi ve Instagram'daki bir yorumda şu ifadelere yer verildi: \"Oyuncu yok, kamera ekibi yok... film yapımının geleceğine hoş geldiniz. Ve bu berbat.\" 'Binlerce çekim' Videonun McDonald's Hollanda YouTube kanalında özel hale getirilmesinin ardından The Sweetshop'un genel müdürü Melanie Bridge, reklamı savundu. Futurism'de aktarıldığı gibi, yapım sürecinin \"yedi hafta\" sürdüğünü, ekibin \"neredeyse hiç uyumadığını\" ve \"binlerce çekim yarattığını ve ardından bunları tıpkı herhangi bir yüksek zanaat prodüksiyonunda yaptığımız gibi kurguda şekillendirdiğini\" söyledi. \"Bu bir filmdi.\" McDonald's Hollanda, BBC News'e yaptığı açıklamada, videonun \"tatil sırasında yaşanabilecek stresli anları yansıtması\" gerektiğini ancak reklamı kaldırma kararı aldığını söyledi. \"Bu an, yapay zekanın etkili kullanımını keşfederken önemli bir öğrenme işlevi görüyor\" dedi. Normalde yüksek tanıtımlı bir Noel kampanyasının başarıya ulaşması bir yıla kadar sürebilirken, şirketler yeni video içeriği oluşturmak için üretken yapay zeka araçlarından gelen yönlendirmeleri kullanarak çok daha kısa bir zaman diliminde film üretebilecek firmaları aramaya başladı. Coca-Cola, art arda yapay zeka tarafından üretilen ikinci Noel reklamıyla halkın en azından bir kısmını etkilemeyi başarmış gibi görünüyor. Reklamı oluşturmak için yapay zekanın kullanılması bölücü olsa da, analiz şirketi Social Sprout'un bir raporu, reklamın çevrimiçi yorumculardan %61'lik bir \"olumlu duyarlılık puanı\" aldığını ortaya çıkardı. Ancak İtalyan lüks moda evi Valentino gibi diğer birçok işletme, kampanyalarında bu tekniği kullandıkları için eleştirilere maruz kaldı ve eleştirmenler Valentino'nun reklamını \"ucuz\" ve \"tembel\" olarak nitelendirdi.

He adds that one client, a hotel chain in the US, is planning to use heat from hotel servers to warm guest rooms, the hotel laundry and swimming pool. In November, a cooling system failure at a data centre in the US sent financial trading tech offline at CME Group, the world's largest exchange operator. Currently, demand for data centres is booming, driven partly by the growth of AI technologies. But the huge amounts of energy and water that many of these facilities consume mean that they are increasingly controversial. More than 200 environmental groups in the US recently demanded a moratorium on new data centres in the country. So much so that many in the industry say traditional cooling methods – such as air cooling, where fans constantly blow air over the hottest components – is no longer sufficient for some operations. We don't have any fans whatsoever – we operate silently.\" Iceotope Iceotope says its tech can cut the cost of cooling by up to 80% Iceotope says its approach to liquid cooling, which can soothe multiple components in a data centre, not just the processing chips, may reduce cooling-related energy demands by up to 80%. I ask whether the oil-based fluids in the firm's cooling system are derived from fossil fuel products and he says some of them are, though he stresses that none contain PFAS, also known as forever chemicals , which are harmful to human health. Some liquid-based data centre cooling technologies use refrigerants that do contain PFAS. Not only that, many refrigerants produce highly potent greenhouse gases, which threaten to exacerbate climate change. Two-phase cooling systems use such refrigerants says Yulin Wang, a former senior technology analyst at IDTechEx, a market research firm. The refrigerant starts out as a liquid but heat from server components causes it to evaporate into a gas and this phase change soaks up a lot of energy, meaning it is an effective way of cooling things down. In some designs, data centre tech is fully immersed in large quantities of PFAS-containing refrigerant. \"There could be some safety issues.\" In other cases, the refrigerant is piped directly to the hottest components, computer chips, only. Some companies that offer two-phase cooling are currently switching to PFAS-free refrigerants. Yulin Wang Yulin Wang warns of safety issues with some cooling chemicals Over the years, firms have experimented with wildly different approaches to cooling, in a race to find the best means of keeping data centre gadgets happy. The idea was that cold Scottish seawater would improve the efficiency of air-based cooling systems inside the device. But the company had learned much from it, says Alistair Speirs, general manager of global infrastructure in the Microsoft Azure business group. Initial findings showed the subsea data centre had a power usage effectiveness, or PUE, rating of 1.07 – suggesting it was far more efficient than the vast majority of land-based data centres. But in the end, Microsoft concluded that the economics of building and maintaining subsea data centres weren't very favourable. The company is still working on liquid-based cooling ideas, including microfluidics, where tiny channels of liquid flow through the many layers of a silicon chip. In July, Renkun Chen, at the University of California San Diego, and colleagues, published a paper detailing their idea for a pore-filled membrane-based cooling technology that could help to cool chips passively – without the need to actively pump fluids or blow air around. He compares it to the process by which water evaporates from a trees' leaves, inducing a pumping effect that draws more water up through the plant's trunk and along its branches to replenish the leaves. New ways of cooling down data centre tech are increasingly sought-after, says Sasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead at Hugging Face, a machine learning company. This is partly due to demand for AI – including generative AI, or large language models (LLMs), which are the systems that power chat bots. Dr Luccioni calls for greater transparency from AI companies regarding how much energy their various products consume. For Mr Ballon, LLMs are just one form of AI – and he argues they have already \"reached their limit\" in terms of productivity.",

Bir enerji şirketi olan MVV Environment'ın proje yöneticisi Felix Hack, Mannheim'daki nehir suyunu emecek ve sudan ısı alındıktan sonra geri gönderecek 2 metre çapındaki boruları anlatırken \"Saniyede 10.000 litre almayı planlıyoruz\" diyor. Ekim ayında, ana firma MVV Energie şimdiye kadarki en güçlü ısı pompası modüllerini üretme planını duyurdu. Her biri 82,5 megawatt kapasiteli iki ünite. Bu, bölgesel ısıtma sistemi aracılığıyla toplamda yaklaşık 40.000 evin ihtiyacını karşılamaya yetiyor. MVV Energie, sistemi daha temiz teknolojilere dönüşen bir kömür santralinin sahasına kurmayı amaçlıyor. \"Nehir yoluyla gelebilir.\" Projeden haberdar olan kişilerden biri, yine son derece büyük ısı pompaları üreten bir başka Alman şirketi olan Everllence'den (eski adıyla MAN Energy Solutions) Alexandre de Rougemont'tur. Bay Hack, Mannheim fabrikasındaki kömür yakıtlı ünitelerin hizmet dışı bırakılmasından bahsederken \"Isı üretimini yeni kaynaklara, özellikle de yenilenebilir kaynaklara dönüştürmemiz konusunda üzerimizde çok fazla baskı vardı\" diye açıklıyor. Tesis, Ren Nehri'nin hemen yanında yer alıyor, zaten güçlü bir elektrik şebekesi bağlantısı var ve bölgesel ısıtma ağına bağlı, bu nedenle ısı pompalarını buraya kurmanın mantıklı olduğunu söylüyor. Kendisi, teknolojinin kısmen petrol ve gaz endüstrisindeki çok büyük kompresörlerin mevcudiyeti sayesinde mümkün olduğunu belirtiyor; bu kompresörler, örneğin depolama veya nakliye için fosil yakıtları sıkıştırmak için kullanılıyor. MVV Energie Mannheim'daki yeni ısı pompası, önümüzdeki yıl başlaması planlanan Mannheim projesindeki Rhine Work'ten ısı aktaracak. Toplam 162 MW kapasiteli ısı pompalarının 2028-29 kışında tam olarak faaliyete geçmesi planlanıyor. Bay Hack, çok adımlı bir filtre sisteminin, ısı pompalarının nehirden balık çekmesini önleyeceğini ve modellemenin, sistemin nehrin ortalama sıcaklığını 0,1°C'den daha az etkileyeceğini öne sürdüğünü ekliyor. Mannheim ısı pompası kurulumunun maliyeti 200 milyon Euro (235 milyon $; 176 milyon £) olacak. Everllence'dan Bay de Rougemont, şirketinde ısı pompası ekipmanının megawatt kurulu kapasite başına yaklaşık 500.000 Euro'ya mal olduğunu söylüyor; buna binaların, ilgili altyapının vb. ek maliyetleri dahil değil. Everllence Everllence'ın Esberg'dekinden daha büyük ısı pompaları için planları var Everllence şu anda Danimarka'nın Aalborg kentinde, Mannheim'daki sistemden daha güçlü olacak ve toplam 176 MW kapasiteye sahip bir proje üzerinde çalışıyor. Ancak daha küçük modüller (44MW'lık dört ünite) kullanacak ve 2027'de faaliyete geçecek ve şehirdeki tüm ısıtma talebinin neredeyse üçte birini karşılayacak. Bu 44 MW'lık makineler aslında Esbjerg'deki Aalborg'un güneyinde, şu anda tamamen çalışır durumda olan önceki bir projede kullanılanlarla aynı. Orada maksimum kapasitede çalışmıyorlar, bunun yerine her biri 35 MW sağlıyorlar. Bay de Rougemont, her biri 200.000 metreküp sıvı tutabilen büyük sıcak su depolama tanklarının sisteme ilave esneklik kazandıracağını ekliyor: \"Elektrik fiyatı yüksek olduğunda, ısı pompanızı durdurursunuz ve yalnızca depodan ısı sağlarsınız.\" Avusturya Teknoloji Enstitüsü'nden Veronika Wilk şöyle diyor: \"Isı pompaları ve bölgesel ısıtma sistemleri mükemmel bir uyum.\" Bu tür sistemler su kütlelerinden ısıyı ve hatta kanalizasyon arıtma tesislerinden gelen atık suyu toplayabilir. Getty Images Helsinki, bölgesel ısıtma sistemini elden geçiriyor Şu ana kadar bahsedilen tüm sistemler, su kaynaklarından enerji topluyor ancak daha az yaygın olarak, çok büyük ısı pompaları, havayı bir ısı kaynağı olarak da kullanabilir. \"Yeterince yüksek sıcaklıkta yeterli su elde etmek için okyanusa 20 km'den daha uzun bir tünel inşa etmemiz gerektiğini hesapladık.\" Helsinki, bölgesel ısıtma sistemini radikal bir şekilde elden geçirme sürecindedir. Bay Aaltonen, şehrin, Finlandiya'nın başkentindeki binaların neredeyse %90'ını birbirine bağlayan 1.400 km'lik bir ağa ısı pompaları, biyokütle brülörleri ve elektrikli kazanlar eklediğini ekliyor. Helen Oy'un neden yüzlerce megavatlık bu kazanları kurmaya karar verdiğini soruyorum ve Bay Aaltonen bunların kurulumunun ısı pompalarından daha ucuz olduğunu ve bunlara sahip olmanın aynı zamanda kendisinin ve meslektaşlarının ölçekte sağlayabileceği ısı miktarı açısından sınırlı olan tamamen havaya güvenmek zorunda olmadıkları anlamına geldiğini söylüyor. Birleşik Krallık'ta Danimarka, Almanya ve Finlandiya'da geliştirilmekte olan sistemlere rakip olabilecek hiçbir ısı pompası bulunmuyor. Ağın planlanan minimum kapasitesi 12 MW'tır. Üç adet 4MW havadan suya ısı pompası içerecek ve ilk ünite 2028'de faaliyete geçecek. Glasgow Caledonian Üniversitesi'nden bölgesel ısıtma sistemlerini araştıran Keith Baker, Birleşik Krallık'ın bu teknolojiden daha fazlasını yapma fırsatlarına sahip olduğunu söylüyor.",

Hastane geçen yıl bu muayeneleri sadece 15 dakikaya indiren yeni bir cihaz monte edene kadar, Londra'daki Royal Brompton Hastanesi'ndeki hastaların belirli akciğer taramaları sırasında yapmak zorunda olduğu şey buydu. Bu kısmen tarayıcıdaki görüntü işleme teknolojisinin yanı sıra, makinenin hastaların akciğerlerinin son derece ayrıntılı, 3 boyutlu görüntülerini üretmesine olanak tanıyan kadmiyum çinko tellür (CZT) adı verilen özel bir malzeme sayesindedir. Nükleer tıp ve PET bölümü başkanı Dr. Kshama Wechalekar, \"Bu tarayıcıdan çok güzel fotoğraflar alıyorsunuz\" diyor. \"Mühendislik ve fizik açısından inanılmaz bir başarı.\" Geçtiğimiz ağustos ayında hastaneye kurulan makinedeki CZT, İngiliz firması Kromek tarafından yapıldı. Kromek dünyada CZT yapabilen az sayıda firmadan biridir. Bu harika malzemenin X-ışını teleskopları, radyasyon dedektörleri ve havaalanı güvenlik tarayıcıları gibi başka birçok kullanım alanı vardır. Dr Wechalekar ve meslektaşları tarafından hastaların akciğerlerinde gerçekleştirilen incelemeler, uzun süredir Kovid geçiren kişilerde çok sayıda küçük kan pıhtısının veya örneğin pulmoner emboli olarak bilinen daha büyük bir pıhtı varlığının araştırılmasını içeriyor. 1 milyon £ değerindeki tarayıcı, hastaların vücutlarına enjekte edilen radyoaktif bir maddenin yaydığı gama ışınlarını tespit ederek çalışıyor. Ancak tarayıcının hassasiyeti, bu maddeye eskisinden daha az ihtiyaç duyulduğu anlamına geliyor: Dr Wechalekar, \"Dozu yaklaşık %30 azaltabiliriz\" diyor. CZT tabanlı tarayıcılar genel olarak yeni olmasa da, bunun gibi büyük, tüm vücut tarayıcıları nispeten yeni bir yeniliktir. Guy's ve St Thomas' NHS Vakfı, Londra'daki Royal Brompton Hastanesi'ndeki en son tarayıcıya sahip Dr. Kshama Wechalekar'a güveniyor. CZT onlarca yıldır piyasada, ancak üretilmesinin oldukça zor olduğu biliniyor. Kromek'in kurucu CEO'su Arnab Basu, \"Endüstriyel ölçekte bir üretim sürecine dönüşmesi uzun zaman aldı\" diyor. Şirketin Sedgefield'deki tesisinde, Dr. Basu'nun \"sunucu çiftliği gibi\" olarak tanımladığı bir odada 170 küçük fırın bulunuyor. Yeni oluşturulmuş bir yarı iletken olan CZT, akıllı telefon kameranızdaki ışığa duyarlı, silikon bazlı görüntü sensörünün son derece uzmanlaşmış bir versiyonu gibi, X ışınları ve gama ışınlarındaki küçük foton parçacıklarını inanılmaz bir hassasiyetle algılayabilir. Yüksek enerjili bir foton CZT'ye çarptığında bir elektronu harekete geçirir ve bu elektrik sinyali bir görüntü oluşturmak için kullanılabilir. Zamanlama, CZT dedektörüne çarpan X-ışınının enerjisi gibi tüm önemli bilgileri korur; renkli veya spektroskopik görüntüler oluşturabilirsiniz.\" CZT tabanlı tarayıcıların şu anda Birleşik Krallık havalimanlarında patlayıcı tespiti ve bazı ABD havalimanlarında kayıtlı bagajları taramak için kullanıldığını ekliyor. \"CZT'nin önümüzdeki [birkaç] yıl içinde el bagajı segmentine gelmesini bekliyoruz.\" Kromek CZT yapmak için özel fırınlara ihtiyaç var Ancak bunu elde etmek her zaman kolay olmuyor. ABD'deki St Louis'deki Washington Üniversitesi'nden Henric Krawczynski, bu materyali daha önce yüksek irtifa balonlarına takılan uzay teleskoplarında kullanmıştı. Prof Krawczynski, teleskopları için çok ince, 0,8 mm'lik CZT parçaları istiyor çünkü bu, topladıkları arka plan radyasyonunun miktarını azaltmaya yardımcı oluyor ve daha net bir sinyal sağlıyor, \"Bu ince olanları almak gerçekten zor.\" CZT'yi Kromek'ten temin edemiyoruz. Her araştırma [projesi] çok özel bir dedektör yapısına ihtiyaç duyar.\" Prof Krawczynski için bu bir kriz değil; bir sonraki görevi için ya daha önceki araştırmalarından elde ettiği CZT'yi ya da bir alternatif olan kadmiyum tellürürü kullanabileceğini söylüyor. Yaklaşan misyonun Aralık ayında Antarktika'dan uçması gerekiyordu ancak Prof Krawczynski, ABD hükümetinin kapanması nedeniyle \"tüm tarihlerin değiştiğini\" söylüyor. Elmas Işık Kaynağı CZT, Elmas Işık Kaynağının yükseltilmesinde kullanılacaktır Diğer birçok bilim insanı CZT kullanmaktadır. Birleşik Krallık'ta, Oxfordshire'daki Elmas Işık Kaynağı araştırma tesisinin yarım milyar sterline mal olan büyük bir yükseltmesi, CZT tabanlı dedektörlerin kurulumu sayesinde yeteneklerini artıracak. Mıknatıslar, vızıldayan bu elektronların X-ışınları şeklinde bir miktar enerji kaybetmesine neden olur ve bunlar, örneğin malzemeleri analiz etmek için kullanılabilmeleri için ışın çizgileri halinde halkadan yönlendirilir. Elmas Işık Kaynağının 2030'da tamamlanması beklenen yükseltmesiyle, üretilen X-ışınları önemli ölçüde daha parlak olacak, bu da mevcut sensörlerin onları düzgün şekilde tespit edemeyeceği anlamına geliyor. Elmas Işık Kaynağının paydaşlarından biri olan Bilim ve Teknoloji Tesisleri Konseyi'nde dedektör geliştirmeden sorumlu grup lideri Matt Veale, \"Ürettikleri ışığı tespit edemiyorsanız, bu tesislerin iyileştirilmesi için tüm bu parayı harcamanın hiçbir anlamı yok\" diyor. Bu nedenle burada da CZT tercih edilen malzemedir.",

      "summary_tr": "Bay Logtenberg, Hollanda'nın Delft kentindeki merkezinde geniş formatlı 3D yazıcılar tasarlayan ve üreten bir şirket olan CEAD'in kurucu ortağıdır. Delft'teki Denizcilik Uygulama Merkezini işlettiklerinden bu yana geçen 12 ay içinde, Hollanda Donanması için RIB'ye benzer 12 metrelik hızlı tekne prototipini zaten inşa ettiler. Denizcilik dünyasında 3D baskı ne kadar ileri gidebilir?",
      "summary_tr_long": "Tekneler 3D baskı teknolojisi için çığır açacak mı? İki yıllık deneyden sonra malzeme nihayet haklı çıktı: Güçlü, güneş ışığından korumak için ekstra kaplamaya ihtiyaç duymayan, kirlenmeye ve denizdeki büyümeye karşı dayanıklı, termoplastik ve fiberglastan oluşan özel bir karışım. Bay Logtenberg, bir teknenin 3 boyutlu olarak basılabileceği mükemmel bir temel olduğunu söylüyor. Ancak aylarca süren kimya ayarlamalarından sonra, Bay Logtenberg ve meslektaşlarının işlettiği yeni fabrikada ilk gövdenin yazıcıdan çıkması yalnızca dört gün sürdü. \"Tekne inşa sürecinin neredeyse %90'ını süper hızlı bir sürede otomatikleştiriyoruz\" diyor. Artık her hafta bir tane basıyoruz.\" Bu, 3D baskının uzun zamandır vaat ettiği türden bir hikaye. Bu sözler her zaman yerine getirilmedi - ancak Bay Logtenberg, denizcilik sektörünün, aynı zamanda katmanlı üretim olarak da bilinen 3D baskının dönüşümsel bir rol oynayabileceği bir sektör olduğuna inanıyor. Bay Logtenberg, Hollanda'nın Delft kentindeki üssünde geniş formatlı 3D yazıcılar tasarlayan ve üreten bir şirket olan CEAD'in kurucu ortağıdır. CEAD, başkalarının kullanması için yazıcılar sağlamakla birlikte, tekne yapımıyla birlikte üretime de katılmaya karar verdi, Bay Logtenberg \"3D baskılı teknelerin hâlâ pazar tarafından kabul edilmesi gerekiyor\" diyor. CEAD Yazıcı, tekneyi her seferinde bir katman halinde oluşturur. Geleneksel fiberglas tekne yapımı, teknenin gerekli güçte olduğundan emin olmak için bir kalıp ve önemli miktarda manuel çalışma gerektirir. Katmanlı üretimde iş, yazılımın ve yazıcının kendisinin (ki bu emek yoğundur) oluşturulması aşamasında tasarım aşamasında zaten yapılmıştır. 3D yazıcılar, temel malzemenin küçük katmanlarını önceden belirlenmiş bir dijital tasarıma göre oluşturarak çalışır. 3D baskının çoğu nispeten küçük ölçekte çalışıyor; diş hekimliği büyük bir etki yarattığı alanlardan biri. CEAD'in en büyük 3D yazıcısı yaklaşık 40 metre (131 ft) uzunluğunda ve Abu Dabi'deki bir müşteri tarafından elektrikli feribot basmak için kullanıldı. Delft'teki Denizcilik Uygulama Merkezini işlettikleri 12 ay içinde, Hollanda Donanması için RIB'ye benzer 12 metrelik hızlı tekne prototipini zaten inşa ettiler. Ve bundan bir şeyler öğrenebilir, altı haftada bir tane daha inşa edebilir ve hatta ilkini geri dönüştürebiliriz.\" Hızlı büyüyen bir diğer alan ise insansız gemilerin (deniz dronları) kullanılmasıdır. CEAD yakın zamanda NATO Özel Kuvvetleri ile birlikte, dronların sahada birkaç saat içinde inşa edildiği ve tasarımların operasyonel gereksinimlere göre değiştiği bir teste katıldı. Bay Logtenberg'e göre, üretimin yerini değiştirme yeteneği 3D baskıyı inanılmaz derecede esnek hale getiriyor. \"6 m'lik küçük bir çalışma teknesi veya bir gemi olması fark etmiyor. 12m askeri bot. \"Yapmamız gereken tek taşıma, büyük torbalarda gelen temel malzemedir ve tekneyle karşılaştırıldığında taşıma açısından oldukça verimlidir.\" Matthew Kenyon Maarten Logtenberg, 8 metre uzunluğunda baskılı bir gövdeyle duruyor Raw Idea Raw Idea, teknelerinin gövdelerinde geri dönüştürülmüş plastik kullanıyor CEAD'den çok da uzak olmayan bir liman kenti olan Rotterdam'da, Raw Idea adlı bir şirket ve onların 'Tanaruz' markası, özellikle kiralama olmak üzere eğlence pazarında benzer bir etki yaratmayı planlıyor. \"Bu pazarlamadır, sosyal medyaya gidip '3D baskılı bir teknemiz var' diyebilirsiniz ve herkes o tekneye bakıp dokunmak ister.\" Bir başka satış noktası da Raw Idea'nın cam elyafı ve geri dönüştürülmüş tüketici plastiklerinin (gazlı içecek şişeleri vb.) bir karışımını kullanmasıdır. \"Bundan beş yıl sonra, 3D baskılı teknelerin, iş tekneleri ve sürat tekneleri gibi hızlı giden tekneler için pazarın kontrolünü ele geçireceğine inanıyorum\" diyor. Hem RAW Idea hem de CEAD, daha öncekilerle karşılaştırılamayacak kaplar üretmek için yeni malzemeler ve yeni fikirler kullandıklarından dolayı Avrupalı ​​düzenleyicilerle neredeyse gerçek zamanlı olarak iletişim halindedir. 3D baskı çoğu zaman devrim niteliğinde bir teknoloji olarak selamlandı ancak bu umutları her zaman karşılayamadı. \"Her şey tek bir şey olarak görülüyor, ancak metal baskı var, polimer veya büyük ölçekli baskı var, tüm bu farklı uygulamalar var. \"Yeterince rekabetçi olmadığı için başarılı olamayan birçok uygulama var, ancak gerçekten gerçekleştiği ve kullanıldığı birkaç uygulama var.\" Eklemeli üretim denizcilik endüstrisinde daha sık kullanılıyor, ancak tüm tekne gövdeleri yerine teknik alanlarda kullanılıyor. 3D baskı denizcilik dünyasında ne kadar ileri gidebilir? Joyce Pont o anın Avrupa'ya gelip gelmeyeceği konusunda şüpheli. öngörülebilir gelecek - süper yatların ve benzeri diğer gemilerin inşasını otomasyona direnecek bir 'zanaat' olarak görüyor. \"12 metrelik bir tekne inşa etmek, bunu bir yıl önce hiç beklemiyordum\" diyor (bir geminin gövdesini) tamamen basmak belki on veya yirmi yıl alacak çünkü daha fazla malzeme araştırmasına ihtiyaç olacak.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Joe Tidy Cyber correspondent, BBC World Service Getty Images Data breaches are getting so common that it can be hard to know how to react when it happens to you. Sue told the BBC how scammers went after her. Sue had her digital life hijacked by scammers She was a victim of what's known as a Sim swap attack - where scammers trick a network operator into thinking they're the account holder to get a new Sim card for a mobile device. \"The scammers took over my Gmail account and then locked me out of my bank accounts because they failed security checks,\" she said. Sue also had a credit card opened in her name and the criminals purchased more than £3,000 in vouchers. \"They sent messages to horse riding groups I am in warning there were people on their way to stab the horses.\" We searched hacker databases using online tools like haveibeenpwned.com and Constella Intelligence to see if Sue's details were previously compromised. Her phone number, email address, date of birth and physical address were all exposed in data breaches at gambling platform PaddyPower in 2010 and email validation tool Verifications.io in 2019. Hannah Baumgaertner, from cyber firm Silobreaker, said attackers likely used the personal data leaked in previous breaches to conduct the Sim swap attack. \"Once they had access to Sue's phone number they were were able to intercept any security codes sent to verify her identity for her Gmail account,\" she said. Fran from Brazil told the BBC she found a user had registered to her Netflix account - and increased her monthly subscription. \"I was charged $9.90 (£7.50) on my payment card, even though I hadn't made this purchase,\" she said. \"I immediately contacted my family to find out if anyone had added another profile to the account we share, but they all said no.\" Fran was a victim of a common scam where her Netflix account was hijacked by a freeloader. It's not known exactly how they got into her account and the murky world of cybercrime means it is difficult to pinpoint if a single data breach led to someone being scammed. But we found Fran's email address had been exposed in at least four data breaches including hacks of Internet Archive (2024), Trellov (2024), Descomplica (2021) and Wattpad (2020) according to the website haveibeenpwned.com. The password she used for her Netflix account is not in publicly known databases but might be in others. \"There is a huge market for cracked Netflix, Disney and Spotify accounts\", said Alon Gal, co founder of cyber security company Hudson Rock. \"It's a low-barrier entry point for cybercrime, turning one company's data leak into widespread, ongoing abuse.\" Scammers often combine stolen private information with public information. Leah, who didn't want to give her real name, runs a small business using Facebook adverts and was recently targeted in a long running scam apparently originating from Vietnam. I clicked on the link and entered my details on the fake Meta page and the scammers were able to take over my business account even though I had 2 factor authentication. I was even barred from using Messenger to complain to Meta.\" In the three days it took Leah to get back her business account back the scammers had run hundreds of pounds of adverts paid for by her. Alberto Casares from Constella Intelligence searched hacker databases and found Leah's email address and other details were taken in data breaches at Gravatar (2020) and this year's Qantas (third-party breach). \"It looks like the attackers used a common technique of linking up Leah's private stolen email address with her publicly listed business number to launch a targeted phishing attack against the email account.\" They could have done this themselves or used a data broker to pay for a number of potential targets he said. Mass data breaches Mass data breaches are fuelling scams and secondary hacks around the world, with several high profile attacks coming in 2025 alone. According to Proton Mail's Data Breach Observatory, there have been 794 verified breaches from identifiable sources discovered so far in 2025 with more than 300 million individual records exposed. \"Criminals pay premium prices for stolen data because it consistently generates profit through fraud, extortion, and cyberattacks,\" said Eamonn Maguire from the firm. Aside from notifying customers and regulators about breaches, there are no hard and fast rules on what companies should do for victims. Last year, Ticketmaster (which saw 500m people affected by a breach) offered this to some people. Co-op chose to give victims a £10 voucher - if they spent £40 in its shops. Some are trying to seek compensation in the courts, with a growing trend of class action lawsuits - though these are notoriously hard to win because it is difficult to prove how individuals have been impacted. T-Mobile has begun paying customers affected by a major data breach in 2021 which affected 76m customers. The firm agreed to pay $350m - with payments reportedly ranging from $50 to $300.",

      "summary_tr_long": "\"It has potential for extraordinary benefits - we will have to work through societal disruptions.\" But the confusing question lingering over the AI hype is whether it is a bubble at risk of bursting - as, if so, it may well be a spectacular burst akin to the dotcom crash at the start of the century, with consequences for us all. Bloomberg via Getty Images A walkway runs along the length of Googleplex, passing by a giant dinosaur skeleton, a beach volleyball pitch and staff lunching in the winter sun The Bank of England has already warned of a \"sudden correction\" in global financial markets, saying \"market valuations appear stretched\" for tech AI firms. Asked whether Google would be immune from a potential bubble burst, Mr Pichai said it could weather that potential storm - but for all his starry-eyed excitement around the possibilities of AI, he also issued a warning: \"I think no company is going to be immune, including us.\" So why, then, is Google investing more than $90bn a year in the AI build-out, a three-fold increase in just four years, at the very moment these suggestions are being discussed? Chipmaker turned AI systems pioneer Nvidia in Santa Clara is now worth more than $5 trillion. A 10-minute drive south, in Cupertino, is Apple HQ, hovering around $4 trillion; while 15 minutes west is $1.9 trillion Meta (previously Facebook). Google's parent firm Alphabet, headquartered in Mountain View, is worth about $3.3 trillion, and has almost doubled in value since April, (which every Googler on campus will no doubt be feeling through the value of their stock options) The purely financial consequences of this trend are significant enough. And that market value is now more highly concentrated in a few firms than it was during the dotcom bubble in 1999, according to the IMF. But he concedes: \"It's also true when we go through these investment cycles, there are moments we overshoot collectively as an industry… \"So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.\" Sundar Pichai: \"We have this phrase at Google, which is 'uncomfortably exciting'.\" Now, a distinction is emerging in the markets between those businesses that rely on often borrowed money and complicated deals to access the chips that power their AI, and the biggest tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which can fund investment in chips and data from their own pockets. The TPUs are part of Sundar Pichai's overall strategy of owning the entire scientific supply chain - from the silicon to the data, plus the AI models and everything in between A core aspect of the AI boom has been the mad dash to amass lots of top-performing chips and put them into data centres (or the physical facilities that store, process and run large amounts of data and software). The chips race - and the OpenAI storm The terrace of the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel, a sprawling 16-acre estate near the Santa Cruz mountains that serves crab rolls and $35 signature vodka martinis, is where the big Silicon Valley deal-making gets done. Getty Images Sam Altman: 'What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure' In a podcast episode that aired last month, an OpenAI investor questioned how the company's spending commitments tallied with its revenues, to which co-founder Sam Altman shot back, challenging the revenue figures quoted, and adding: \"If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough.\" He has since shared a lengthy post on X, explaining, among other things, that OpenAI is looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next eight years and why he believes now is the time to invest in scaling up their technology. But he also said: \"What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure.\" Getty Images Elon Musk and Larry Ellison are said to have begged Nvidia's Jensen Huang to sell them more top-performing chips during a dinner in Nobu Elsewhere, there have been notable very recent falls in share prices of AI infrastructure companies - Coreweave, a start-up that supplies OpenAI, saw its shares lose 26% of their value earlier this month. ChatGPT versus Gemini 3.0 None of this has dampened the excitement over AI's potential within the industry. Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, launched to great fanfare earlier this week — this will pitch Google in a direct battle with OpenAI and its still-dominant ChatGPT for the market share. By 2030, data centres around the world will use about as much electricity as India did in 2023, according to the IMF. I put this to Google's Mr Pichai, asking if it is coherent to have ambitions to generate 95% of electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030 - as the UK government does - and also be an AI superpower? The physical footprint left behind, however, containing sheer computing firepower for the deployment of mass AI technologies, will inevitably shape our economy and could well also shape how we work and learn - and who dominates the world for the rest of the 21st Century.",

      "summary_tr_long": "On the front line of Europe's standoff with Russia's sanction-busting shadow fleet Jessica Parker, Berlin correspondent, Baltic Sea and Ned Davies, BBC Verify Getty Images The BBC joined coastguards on the front line of Europe's uneasy standoff with Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\" Out on the western Baltic, a coastguard officer radios a nearby, sanctioned oil tanker. European coastguards and navies are regularly coming in contact with vessels in Russia's shadow fleet which they suspect are transporting oil Some \"shadow\" ships are even suspected of undersea sabotage, illicit drone launches or \"spoofing\" their location data. As the BBC has learned, a growing network of \"shadow\" ships are sailing without a valid national flag, which can render vessels stateless and without proper insurance. That is a troubling trend, given many are practically \"floating rust buckets\", says senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI, Michelle Wiese Bockmann. Driven by record sanctions and tighter enforcement, the number of falsely flagged ships globally has more than doubled this year to over 450, most of them tankers, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) database. The BBC has been tracking one ship that appears to have sailed without a valid flag. The head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says that vessels travel back and forth, past Estonia, to major Russian oil terminals The head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says they have seen dozens of such passing vessels this year whereas they used to see just one or two. What's more, he suggests, it's brazen: \"There's no secret made about it.\" We spot the tanker Unity on the MarineTraffic app, the day we board an Estonian (British-built) Minehunter that is also used in Nato's Baltic Sentry patrols to protect critical infrastructure. Journeying east, Unity is over 100 miles away but sailing in our direction. The BBC has investigated its history and it offers an illuminating insight into the enigmatic life of a shadow ship. Originally known as Ocean Explorer, the tanker was built in 2009 and flew the flag of Singapore for more than a decade. Back in 2019, it was named in a UN report for alleged involvement in a ship-to-ship transfer with a vessel that had been sanctioned for its role in transporting fuel to North Korea - which is among other countries also charged with utilising elusive shadow ships. By late 2021, the vessel – which that year operated under the name Ocean Vela – took the flag of the Marshall Islands but was struck from that list in 2024, a registry spokesperson told us, because the ship's then-operator and beneficial owning company had been sanctioned by the UK. The tanker appears to have had three further names since 2021 (Beks Swan, March and Unity) and three further flags (Panama, Russia and Gambia) but always retains a unique IMO number. Lesotho is a small, landlocked African enclave kingdom that, according to the IMO, does not have an official registry. Over the past year, Unity has made several voyages to and from Russian oil ports The BBC has tried to contact Unity's listed owner, a Dubai-registered company called FMTC Ship Charter LLC , but our emails and our calls went unanswered. The beneficial owners of 60% of shadow fleet vessels remain essentially unknown, according to maritime intelligence company Windward AI. By 6 November, it was anchored outside the Russian port of Ust-Luga where it remains at the time of publication. The tanker was added to the UK and EU's ever-growing list of sanctioned vessels earlier this year but, like so many others, continues to do business despite other difficulties. Planet Labs At the time of publication the vessel was anchored just outside the major Russian oil port, Ust-Luga Unity is just one of hundreds of vessels subject to UK and EU service and port bans as both London and Brussels try to increase pressure on the Kremlin. Nevertheless, Russian revenues from crude and oil product sales were $13.1bn (£9.95bn) in October alone, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) - although this was down by $2.3bn when compared with the same month a year ago. Analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air finds that \"shadow\" tankers, either sanctioned or suspected, account for 62% of shipped Russian crude oil exports, while China and India are by far the biggest customers for crude, followed by Turkey and the European Union itself. \"Every day in the Baltic, there's suspicious activity,\" a Nato official told the BBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \"You need to see it in a larger perspective,\" says investigator Jonatan Tholin when I suggest these measures appear less than muscular: \"This information can be used in our maritime surveillance.\" But as Europe steps up checks and watches the waves, Windward's Michelle Wiese Bockmann spies something else: \"You can literally see the international rules-based order crumbling through the sanctions-circumventing tactics of these vessels.\" There is a lot at stake for the environment and on security, she says, and meanwhile \"the dark fleet is getting darker\". The BBC approached Russia's embassy in London for comment.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Shiona McCallum Senior technology reporter BBC Most women will relate to the misery of inconsistent sizing in high-street shops. A pair of jeans could easily be a size 10 by one brand and a size 14 in another, leaving customers confused and disheartened. It has led to a global deluge of returns, costing fashion retailers an estimated £190bn a year as would-be shoppers wonder what size they're meant to buy from which store. I didn't have to look far to find people experiencing the problem. \"I don't trust high-street sizing,\" one person tells me, as she browses one of London's popular shopping streets. \"To be honest, I buy by how it looks rather than the actual size.\" She's one of many women who often orders multiple versions of the same item to find one that fits, before sending the rest back, fuelling a culture of mass returns. A new generation of sizing tech A growing cluster of tech companies are now attempting to fix the problem. Tools such as 3DLook, True Fit and EasySize focus on helping customers choose the right size at checkout, using body scans via smartphone photos to suggest the most accurate fit. Meanwhile, virtual fitting-room platforms including Google's virtual try-on, Doji, Alta, Novus, DRESSX Agent and WEARFITS allow shoppers to create digital avatars and preview how items might look. These systems aim to increase confidence when buying online. More recently, AI-powered shopping agents have begun entering the market too. Daydream, allows users to describe what they are looking for and then recommends options. OneOff pulls together looks from celebrities to find similar items, while Phia scans tens of thousands of websites to compare prices and surface early \"size insights.\" While these tools work at the e-commerce stage, a new UK start-up, Fit Collective, is taking a different approach: trying to prevent the problem earlier in the production process. Founder Phoebe Gormley argues AI can potentially fix the sizing before clothes reach the stores. The 31-year-old - who is no data scientist, rather a tailor - previously launched Savile Row's first female tailors, making made-to-measure garments for a range of women. \"They would all come in and say, 'high-street sizing is so bad',\" she tells me. She says fashion's current model is a \"downward spiral\" where brands make cheaper garments to offset huge return rates, which leads to unhappy customers and more waste. Since launching last year, Fit Collective has raised £3 million in pre-seed funding, reportedly the largest amount ever secured by a solo female founder in the UK. \"As far as we know, we are the first solution comparing all the manufacturing data and the commercial data,\" she says. Phoebe's new venture uses machine learning to analyse a range of data - including returns, sales figures and customer emails - to really understand why something didn't fit. It then turns this into clear advice for design and production teams, who can adjust patterns, sizing and materials before manufacturing begins. Her system may tell a firm, for example, to take a few centimetres off the length of an item of clothing to reduce the number of returns overall. This saves money for the company and time for the consumer. Despite what the labels may say, it's clear these jeans aren't all the same size While many in the industry welcome such tools, some warn technology alone won't fix fashion's sizing problem. \"People aren't mannequins, they're unique, and so are their fit preferences,\" says Paul Alger, Director of International Business at the UK Fashion and Textile Association. He warns sizing can be nuanced, with body measurements rarely aligning with a number on a label. \"It's very difficult, it's very subjective,\" he says. \"Most of us are a different shape and size - around the world people have different body shapes.\" And then there's the issue of vanity sizing - or \"emotional sizing\" according to Mr Alger - where a brand will deliberately choose to create a more generous fit in the knowledge that a consumer, especially in women's wear, will prefer to shop there. \"Once these sizing norms are established in a collection, brands will usually refer back to them each season so they are effectively creating their own brand sizing,\" he says. Sophie De Salis, sustainability policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium, says retailers are increasingly aware of the issue, from a cost-saving and sustainability perspective. \"Smarter sizing tech and AI-driven solutions are key to reducing returns and supporting the industry's sustainability goals. BRC members are working with innovative tech providers to help their customers buy the most suitable size and reduce returns,\" she says. With returns now a board room issue and sustainability pressures mounting, more fashion houses may well consider data-driven design. While no single solution is likely to solve inconsistent sizing completely, the emergence of tools like Fit Collective, alongside a growing ecosystem of virtual try-ons and size-prediction platforms, suggests the industry is beginning to shift.",

Video oyunlarının en bilinen isimlerinden biri olan bu seri, çok az tanıtıma ihtiyaç duyuyor. Yayıncı Activision'a göre tahmini olarak 500 milyon kopya satıldı, bir film uyarlaması da yolda ve 2003'te vizyona girmesine rağmen hala güvenilir bir şekilde yıllık en çok satanlar listelerinde üst sıralarda veya buna yakın bir yerde görünüyor. Ancak bu yıl dünyanın en iyi askeri nişancısının elinde bir kavga olabilir. Rakip oyun devi Electronic Arts için büyük bir başarı olan Battlefield 6, dikkatleri tecrübeli rakibinden uzaklaştırıyor. Ve uzun süredir Call of Duty hayranları, serinin kökleriyle bağını kaybetmesiyle ilgili endişelerini giderek daha fazla dile getiriyor. Çok oyunculu devlerin çatışması, hayranların serinin yolunu kaybetmesiyle ilgili endişelerine yanıt vermek zorunda kalan Call of Duty yapımcıları için ilginç bir zamana denk geliyor. Uzun süredir oyunculara, karakterlerinin görünümünü değiştiren \"operatör görünümleri\" satın alma şansı sunuyordu. Bunlar sıklıkla marka geçişlerinin kaynağıdır ve önceki tasarımlar futbolcu Neymar Jr, yayıncı NickMercs ve rapçi Nicki Minaj gibi yıldızlara dayanıyordu. Ancak Activision, bu yılın başlarında 90'ların çizgi film karakterleri Beavis ve Butthead'i temel alan kaplamaları ortaya çıkardığında tepkiyle karşılaştı. Hayranlar şirketi, pop yıldızı Sabrina Carpenter ve 2025'te yapay zeka tarafından seslendirilen Darth Vader'ın da dahil olduğu, bazen alışılmadık geçişleriyle ünlü, her zaman popüler olan çok oyunculu oyun Fortnite'ı taklit etmeye çalışmakla suçladı. Activision, hayranlardan gelen geri bildirimlerin olumlu etki yaptığını ve serinin kimliğini kaybetmesiyle ilgili şikayetleri ciddiye aldığını söyledi. Ayrıca ana şirket Microsoft'un Game Pass abonelik hizmetinin fiyatlarını %20 oranında arttırarak birçok oyuncuyu kızdırmasının ardından da piyasaya sürülüyor. Activision Black Ops oyunları, oyuncuları casusluk ve komplo dünyasına sürüklüyor BBC News, baş yapımcı Natalie Pohorski ve kıdemli iletişim direktörü Stephanie Snowdon ile masaya oturduğunda, Black Ops 7'nin tek oyunculu hikaye kampanyası hakkında konuşmak istiyorlar. Battlefield 6'daki eşdeğer mod, eleştirmenler tarafından yetersiz bulundu ve Call of Duty ekipleri, anlatım modlarında patlayıcı set parçaları oluşturma becerileriyle tanınıyor. Serinin Black Ops temalı bölümleri genellikle büyük komploları ortaya çıkaran gizli ajanların Hollywood gişe rekorları kıran tarzı hikayelerini anlatıyor. Black Ops 7, 2035'te geçen, 2012 yapımı Black Ops 2'nin doğrudan devamı niteliğindedir ve küresel bir terör tehdidi ile karanlık ve büyük bir teknoloji şirketini içeren bir hikayeyi anlatır. Natalie, \"Black Ops kimliğinin\" geliştiricilere başkalarının keşfedemeyeceği temaları keşfetmesine olanak tanıdığını söylüyor. \"Sonra da her çağ için geçerli olabilecek pek çok soru soruyoruz; güven soruları, gördüklerinize inanabiliyor musunuz?\" Activision Milo Ventimiglia, kahraman David Mason rolünü üstleniyor Oyun sektörünün en büyük isimlerinden biri olmak, Activision'ın bazı önemli yetenekleri Call of Duty projelerine çekmesine de olanak tanıyor. Black Ops 7 için, Netflix'in Chilling Adventures of Sabrina filmindeki rolüyle tanınan Kiernan Shipka ve This Is Us yıldızı Milo Ventimiglia'yı içeriyor. Kiernan, BBC News'e Call of Duty'nin büyük profilinin ve hayranlarının beklentilerinin farkında olduğunu söyledi. Katılmanın \"dürüst olmak gerekirse her şeyden daha heyecan verici\" olduğunu söylüyor. \"Bir fandomu seviyorum\" diyor. \"Ve bence zamanla hayranlarda bu kadar tutku uyandıran bir şey, gerçekten harika bir şeye adım attığınız anlamına geliyor. \"Eğer bu tür şeylerin içeri girmesine izin verirsem, bu iyi bir şey değil.\" Milo, daha gençken Call of Duty oynamış biri olarak, hayranların sahip olduğu standartların da farkında olduğunu söylüyor. Oyuncuların yıllık serilerden \"yorulup yorulmadığını\" düşünüp düşünmediği sorulduğunda, Black Ops 7'nin hayal kırıklığına uğratmayacağını söylüyor.

Belfast'ta bir ahşap işleme şirketi olan Halt'un genel ve teknik müdürü Stephen McCann şöyle diyor. Ancak Burnblock adı verilen bir madde içeren bu sıvının, yapılan testlerde yangının ahşabı tutmasını önlediği gösterildi. Ne Bay McCann ne de Danimarkalı bir firma olan Burnblock'un genel müdürü Hroar Bay-Smidt, içerikleri doğrulayacak. Bununla birlikte, Danimarka Teknoloji Enstitüsü'nden Burnblock'un web sitesinde yer alan belgeler, alev geciktirici bileşenin \"vücuttaki doğal bir bileşen\" olduğunu ve karışımın aynı zamanda sitrik asit ve \"bazı meyvelerde doğal bir bileşen\" içerir. Alev geciktiriciler, yanmalarını yavaşlatmak için ürünlere eklenen kimyasallar, yüzyıllardır çeşitli şekillerde mevcuttur. Ancak 20. yüzyılda geliştirilen alev geciktiricilerin çoğu oldukça zehirlidir.

Halt tarafından işlenen ahşapla inşa edilen bina veya tesislerin bugüne kadar herhangi bir yangından etkilenip etkilenmediğini soruyorum; cevap \"Hayır\". Halt, ahşabı vakuma, basınca ve alev geciktirici bir sıvıya maruz bırakıyor. Halt'un binalarından birinde, otoklav adı verilen ve çoğunlukla iki büyük yatay tüpten oluşan devasa bir makine var. Altındaki tüp ahşap parçalarıyla yüklendiğinde, önce bunları bir vakuma maruz bırakarak ahşabın gözeneklerini açıyor, Bay McCann, daha sonra, işleme sıvısıyla birlikte söz konusu ahşap türüne uygun basınç uygulandığını söylüyor Bay McCann, \"Bu basıncın yaptığı şey, yangın geciktiriciyi ahşabın tam merkezine doğru itmektir\" diyor. Bundan sonra ahşap, 10 günden altı haftaya kadar sürebilen bir süreçte kurutuluyor. \"Kereste harika bir malzemedir\" diyor Üniversitesi'nden fahri profesör. Lancashire, \"2000'li yılların başlarında kil nanokompozitleri üzerinde çok fazla çalışma yapıldı\" diyor ve ekliyor: \"Şimdi, 20-25 yıl sonra, bunların esasen %99'u boşa çıktı.\" Alex Morgan, yeni alev geciktirici kimyasallar bulma konusunda bir mücadele olduğunu söylüyor, çünkü plastikler artan bir hızla yanmaya eğilimlidir, diye ekliyor. İnşaatta yaygın olarak kullanılan bir plastik türü olan polietileni, benzer kimyasal yapısı ve hızlı yanma kapasitesi nedeniyle \"katı benzin\" olarak adlandırıyor. First Graphene, Avustralya'da, petek kafeslerinde düzenlenmiş küçük karbon atomu parçacıkları olan grafen ekleyerek, firmanın çözümü PureGRAPH'ın madencilik endüstrisinde kullanılan koruyucu ayakkabılar ve taşıma bantları dahil olmak üzere ürünlere zaten eklendiğini söylüyor. koruyucu bir gaz bariyeri oluşturarak, tutuşmadan önce uçucu bileşiklerin salınmasını önleyerek ve ayrıca tutuşma meydana geldiğinde bir kömür tabakası oluşturarak çalıştığını söylüyor. Ancak grafen, esrarengiz bir malzeme olarak biliniyor ve şirket, henüz tam olarak anlaşılamayan başka mekanizmaların da iş başında olabileceğini söylüyor. Birleşik Krallık'ta Vector Homes, ön panolar gibi inşaat malzemeleri yapımında kullanılabilecek plastik pelet üreticilerine PureGRAPH lisansını satmaya hazırlanıyor. Kurucu ortak ve baş teknoloji sorumlusu Liam Britnell, \"Bu testlerde en yüksek puanları aldı\" diyor. İşte bu nedenle Stanford Üniversitesi'nden Eric Appel ve meslektaşları, hasarı sınırlamak için yangının ulaşmasından saatler önce eve püskürtülebilecek jel benzeri yangın geciktiriciler üzerinde çalışıyorlar. Laboratuar çalışması, üzerinde çalıştığı jellerden birinin aleve maruz kalması üzerine kabarcıklar çıkararak içinde yangına karşı oldukça koruyucu olan gözenekli bir aerojel yapısı oluşturduğunu ortaya çıkardı.

      "summary_tr_long": "'This is the big one' - tech firms bet on electrifying rail Chris Baraniuk Technology Reporter AFP via Getty Images Diesel locomotives are being replaced with electric models Every day, thousands of passengers heading south west on trains leaving Aldershot station pass a cluster of solar panels nestled by the tracks. \"On a sunny afternoon, if you are catching a train through Aldershot, a little bit of the energy for that train will come from those solar panels,\" says Leo Murray, co-founder and chief executive of Riding Sunbeams, a start-up aiming to use renewable energy resources for rail electrification projects. Riding Sunbeams built the Aldershot array in 2019 . It's small in scale at just 40 kilowatts – equivalent to roughly 10 of the rooftop solar arrays you would find on a typical British home. Not only that, Mr Murray says it is currently the only solar array in the country that delivers power directly to rail to move trains. To go electric, rail operators have traditionally had two options: electrified rail, or overhead lines that that trains connect to with arm-like pantographs on their roofs. But engineers are working on new ways of implementing such technologies and completely different alternatives are also emerging, which could speed up electrification projects. Mr Murray says that, after the Aldershot project, he had hoped Riding Sunbeams would go on to build a full-scale commercial pilot. Now, however, Network Rail, which owns and maintains railway infrastructure in Great Britain, is seeking suppliers for rail-side renewables projects. Riding Sunbeams Leo Murray would like to see more solar panels next to railway tracks New projects bring new complexities, however. At Aldershot, the track was already electrified – it was a case of plugging solar panels in to that existing system. But for trains that are switching off diesel and moving over to overhead lines, leveraging solar is harder. This is because solar panels produce direct current (DC) electricity whereas overhead lines use alternating current (AC). Separately, Colton Junction between Leeds and York, the fastest railway junction in the UK – where trains speed through at up to 125mph – was electrified recently with the help of software developed at the University of Huddersfield. The software makes a 3D model of the overhead line system, allowing engineers to plan its construction in minute detail – lowering costs by removing the need for certain forms of traditional testing and evaluation. \"Everything was specified in the software in terms of measurements,\" says João Pombo, associate director of the university's Institute of Railway Research. \"All the trains are running at maximum speed at that junction since August.\" Nevomo Poland's Nevomo has developed an electromagnetic propulsion system But there are completely different ideas for electrification out there. It's retrofitted onto existing track by fitting a thick aluminium cable into an enclosure that runs between the rails. They can also operate in groups.\" A key benefit of the technology, says Mr Paczek, is that it allows operators to bring freight wagons to a stop very quickly – and, as a consequence, that means they could, in principle, safely put lots of independently moving wagons relatively close together on one stretch of rail, increasing the density of freight transportation in a particular area. Nevomo hopes to launch working implementations of its technology at a steel plant in Bremen, Germany, and at a port in India next year. These will be relatively small in scale, each covering track distances of less than 1km (0.6 miles). \"In a quite conservative environment like rail, we need to demonstrate it properly first.\" It would be possible to automate the motion of electromagnetically-propelled wagons, he adds – though initially they will be controlled remotely by human operators. University of Birmingham New railways tech needs to prove there's a business case says Stuart Hillmansen In the US, Parallel Systems is also working on electrifying individual freight wagons so that they can move independently around a rail network – but in a very different way, with batteries. The firm's wagons would have a range of 800km, says co-founder and chief executive Matt Soule. He describes it like moving packets around a distribution centre – \"atomised freight\", and quite unlike traditional locomotive-pulled freight trains that can be more than 2km long . He adds that he does not aim to replace freight locomotives, but rather to offer a rail-based delivery service that could compete with trucking. \"If we simply grab 10% of the trucking market, we've doubled the rail industry,\" he says. Stuart Hillmansen at the University of Birmingham, who has worked with Riding Sunbeams in the past, says organising the movement of individual freight trains on an existing rail network could be \"quite challenging – certainly on [British] railways\". But he says that new technologies are helping to facilitate electrification – and that electrified trains in general are now the \"go-to\" option for new railways. \"All of these technologies are physically feasible and can work, the thing is managing the business case,\" he says.",

Kanadalı 73 yaşındaki kişi, \"Önemli ölçüde gelişti ancak tamamen otonom bir arabaya benzeyen herhangi bir şeyden çok uzak\" diyor.",
      "summary_tr_long": "For the past few weeks, Geoff Perlman, a 61-year-old technology executive from Texas, has been testing a free trial of Tesla's latest self-driving software as he travels around Austin. He's expecting to recommend that his 89-year-old father-in-law upgrades his own Tesla with the system, which costs an extra $8,000 (£5,950), to help out as old age closes in. But the move has renewed alarm among safety advocates about what they perceive as Musk's willingness to take safety short cuts, as advances by rivals like Google's Waymo raise pressure on the firm to deliver on its promises of self-driving cars. Bloomberg via Getty Elon Musk, introducing Autopilot in 2015, said drivers could not \"abdicate responsibility. That will come at some point in the future\" \"Tesla doesn't always seem to have full grasp of what the consequences of its technology changes would be and I think this is kind of a very big example of that,\" says Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety. \"Essentially what Tesla is saying here is they are going to allow their drivers to break the law.\" Tesla's automated options for car-buyers range from Autopilot, which has features such as automatic lane centring, to a more advanced software it launched in 2020 as Full Self Driving or FSD. Currently only available in North America, Australia and New Zealand, FSD has additional powers, like the ability to summon your car via app, or have it park and navigate itself. Both systems technically require driver supervision at all times, bringing the firm's decision to make it easier to text in tension with laws in the US, the UK and elsewhere that make texting while driving illegal. For example, according to the company, cars with its FSD features have seven times fewer major collisions. Austin American-Statesman via Getty Images Tesla is facing competition from Waymo and other players 'Serious concerns' But experts have questioned the reliability of the data that Tesla uses to support its safety claims - the company does not share it for outside review or present with any information to compare it to. Regulators in the US have also opened numerous investigations into how well Tesla's software works, after reports of issues including random braking and cars failing to comply with basic traffic safety rules , such as stop signs. \"Until we have assurances, independent assurances, that any vehicle is able to perform all of the driving tasks, then it should not be permissible to be distracted behind the wheel.\" Youssef Kamal Youssef Kamal admits to checking his phone while in his Tesla New Jersey Tesla owner Youssef Kamal says he would not rely on Tesla to navigate while typing out a long message, but even when using an enhanced version of Autopilot, he has overall confidence in the system. Ernie Gorrie says his car still performs erratically, stumped by signals like flashing yellow lights, five years after he received the first FSD software. \"It has improved substantially but it remains far from anything resembling a full self-driving car,\" the 73-year-old from Canada says. Ernest Gorrie Ernie Gorrie bought a Tesla in 2019, inspired in part by Musk's talk of self-driving cars Driver monitoring Last year, in the face of regulator pressure, Tesla added the word (Supervised) to the title of its FSD software. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating changes to driver monitoring that Tesla promised in 2023, after a previous probe found \"foreseeable\" misuse of Autopilot had played a role in more than a dozen fatal accidents. But the US does not currently have clear rules governing how much responsibility carmakers have to ensure that drivers remain attentive, leaving that question in contested legal territory. In August, a Miami jury ordered Tesla to pay $243m million in damages over a fatal 2019 crash involving Autopilot after finding, in part, that the company did not have adequate guards in place to track driver attentiveness or prevent the system from being used on unsafe roads. CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Manufacturers in China and other places have introduced unmanned vehicles, raising pressure on Tesla to deliver on its promises This month, the company started sending its robotaxis onto the roads in Texas without a human behind the wheel. \"Waymo has been ahead of them for a decade and is now way ahead.\" Waymo currently dominates the robotaxi space in the US, with a fleet of more than 2,500 fully driverless taxis and plans to operate in more than 15 cities next year, including London. Meanwhile, outside the US, regulators have already approved hands-off technology from several Chinese carmakers, and Mercedes, for certain driving conditions. 'High risk game' As Tesla pushes to expand FSD into new markets, Simeon Calvert, professor of automated driving at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, says it will have to satisfy regulators on safety questions. In Europe, for example, where Musk has said he hopes to win approval for FSD as soon as February, carmakers are mandated to have effective strategies to warn inattentive drivers.",

İşçi Partisi'nin manifestosu mevcut AB gümrük birliğine üye olmayı reddetti. Son zamanlarda, Sağlık Bakanı Wes Streeting ve Başbakan Yardımcısı David Lammy gibi üst düzey kabine bakanları bu kırmızı çizgilerin kenarlarında dans ederek, Brexit'in ekonomik hasarı olarak gördükleri durumdan yakınarak ve daha yakın ilişkilerin erdemlerini övdüler. Bu ayın başlarında, 13 İşçi Partisi milletvekili, hükümetin AB ile özel bir gümrük birliğine katılma müzakerelerine başlamasını gerektiren Liberal Demokrat yasa tasarısını destekledi. Muhafazakarlar ve Reformcu Birleşik Krallık gümrük birliğine yeniden katılmaya karşı çıkıyor ve bunun Brexit'in faydaları olarak gördükleri şeyleri zayıflatacağını söylüyor. Gümrük birliği, Birleşik Krallık ile AB arasındaki mallara uygulanan tarifeleri veya vergileri ortadan kaldırarak bürokrasiyi azaltacaktır. Ancak eleştirmenler, AB'nin gümrük birliği alanı dışından gelen tüm mallara ortak bir tarife uygulayacağı ve Birleşik Krallık'tan ortak standartlara uymasını bekleyeceği için bunun Birleşik Krallık'ın özel küresel ticaret anlaşmaları yapma yeteneğini de ciddi şekilde kısıtlayacağına dikkat çekiyor. Nowak, BBC'ye verdiği bir röportajda şunları söyledi: \"2026 gerçekten de hükümetin yaşam pahalılığı kriziyle baş etmeye başladığı yıl olmalı.\" \"Süpermarketlerimizde fiyatları bu kadar yüksek görmemizin nedenlerinden biri de kötü Brexit anlaşması\" dedi ve şunu ekledi: \"Hükümet kesinlikle hiçbir şeyi göz ardı etmemeli. Avrupa Birliği ile ilişkimiz için gümrük birliğine kadar her seçeneğe bakmalılar. \"Havacılık, otomotiv, çelik gibi iş yerlerini haftalarca dolaşıyorum ve Avrupa ile iyi bir anlaşmaya sahip olmak çok önemli.\" 2023'te TUC'nin genel sekreteri olan Nowak da hükümetin bunu yapması gerektiğini söyledi. Joseph Rowntree Vakfı'nın, mali açıdan kendini güvende hissetmeyen seçmenlerin, kendilerini daha güvende hissedenlere göre daha fazla oranda İşçi Partisi'nden ayrıldığını öne süren araştırmasına dikkat çekti. TUC'nin kendisi, beş kişiden birinin bazı öğünleri atladığını öne süren bir anket yaptırdı ve Nowak, hükümetin bazı ailelere yardım etmek için zaten açıkladığı iki çocuk yardım sınırını kaldırmak gibi eylemleri övdü. TUC lideri olarak Nowak, beş milyondan fazla üyeye sahip 47 sendikayı temsil ediyor ve hükümetin ona verdiği mesaj şu: Yeni yürürlüğe giren İstihdam Hakları Yasası'nın uygulanmasında geri adım atılmamalı. Mevzuat, işçilere işe başladıkları ilk günden itibaren hastalık maaşı ve babalık izni verecek ve hamile kadınlar ve yeni anneler için yeni korumalar içeriyor. Kasım ayında İşçi Partisi, tüm işçilere işe başladıkları ilk günden itibaren haksız işten çıkarma hakkı verme planından geri adım attı. Muhafazakarlar, yasanın işletmelere yeni yükler getireceğini ve işleri ortadan kaldıracağını söyledi. Nowak ayrıca, sendikaların işyerlerinde örgütlenmesini engellemeye çalıştıkları takdirde karşılaşacakları cezalara bir üst sınır getirilmemesi çağrısında bulundu ve yeni hakların \"işin ücretini artırarak\" ve istihdamı daha güvenli hale getirerek yaşam standartlarını yükselteceğini vurguladı. Enerji faturalarını düşürmek, demiryolu ücretlerini ve reçete ücretlerini dondurmak ve geçim ücretini artırmak gibi diğer bütçe önlemlerine işaret ederek, \"İstihdam Hakları Yasası'nın kabul edilmesiyle, bunu tam ve zamanında uygulamaya yönelik açık bir kararlılıkla 21. Yüzyıl için işçi haklarını dönüştüreceğiz\" diye eklediler. İşçi Partisi anketlerde Reform Birleşik Krallık'ın gerisinde kalıyor, ancak Nowak çözümün göç konusunda \"aynı adıma geçmek\" olmadığını söyledi. \"Düşük ekonomik düzeyde keskin uçta olan pek çok insan için ücretli işte çalışıyorlarsa, değişimin gelmediğini ya da yeterince hızlı geldiğini düşünüyorlar. \"Fakat pek çok insan için Reform'da basit bir cevap var gibi görünüyor. Ana akım siyasetin insanların istediği değişimi sağlayabileceğini gösterme sorumluluğu hükümette.\" Ancak görünen o ki hoşnutsuz seçmenler sadece Reform'a yönelmiyor. Sol aday Andrea Egan, bu ay ülkenin en büyük sendikası Unison'un lideri olarak seçildi ve hükümetten yön değişikliği ve İşçi Partisi liderinin değişmesi çağrısında bulunuyor. Görevdeki Christina McAnea'nın destekçileri, onun İşçi Partisi liderliğine algılanan yakınlığının şansına zarar verdiğini hissettiler. Nowak şunları söyledi: \"Sadece kamuoyu yoklamalarına bakmanız yeterli; başbakan da kişisel olarak mücadele ediyor. \"Hükümet yaşam standartlarını iyileştirmeyi başarabilirse, o zaman sandıkların kendi başının çaresine bakacağını düşünüyorum. Bir İşçi Partisi hükümeti iddialı ve ön planda olduğunda her zaman en iyi durumdadır.\"",

ABD'de daimi ikamet eden Bay Ahmed, gözaltına alınmanın ve muhtemelen sınır dışı edilmenin kendisini Amerikalı karısından ve çocuğundan ayıracağı konusunda uyarmıştı. Yargıcın kararını överek BBC News'e \"zorbalığa uğramayacağını\" söyledi. Dışişleri Bakanı Marco Rubio internette, bu kişilerin ABD platformlarına \"karşı çıktıkları Amerikan bakış açılarını sansürlemeleri ve cezalandırmaları\" için baskı yapma çabaları organize ettikleri yönündeki endişeler nedeniyle engellendiğini söyledi. Bay Ahmed, kendisine yaptırım uygulanması kararı nedeniyle Çarşamba günü aralarında Rubio ve ABD Başsavcısı Pamela Bondi'nin de bulunduğu yetkililere karşı yasal şikayette bulundu. BBC tarafından görülen mahkeme belgelerinde, ABD Bölge Hakimi Vernon S Broderick Perşembe günü Ahmed'in geçici uzaklaştırma emri talebini kabul ettiğini söyledi. Hakim ayrıca, yetkililerin Bay Ahmed'i davasının görülmesine fırsat vermeden gözaltına almasını da geçici olarak engelledi. BBC, yorum almak üzere Dışişleri Bakanlığı ve Beyaz Saray ile temasa geçti. AFP haber ajansının kendisine ulaşması üzerine, bir dışişleri bakanlığı sözcüsünün şunları söylediği aktarıldı: \"Yüksek Mahkeme ve Kongre defalarca şunu açıkça ifade etti: ABD, yabancı uzaylıların ülkemize gelmesine veya burada ikamet etmesine izin verme yükümlülüğü altında değildir.\" Bay Ahmed şunları söyledi: \"Çocukları sosyal medyanın zararlarından korumak ve çevrimiçi antisemitizmi durdurmak için hayatım boyunca verdiğim mücadeleden zorbalığa uğramayacağım.\" Avukatı Roberta Kaplan, hakimin kararının hızının önemli olduğunu söyledi. \"Federal hükümet, eşi ve Amerikalı küçük çocuğu olan Imran Ahmed gibi yeşil kart sahibi bir kişiyi sırf onun söyleyeceklerinden hoşlanmadığı için sınır dışı edemez\" dedi. 2023 yılında, Bay Ahmed'in merkezi, Elon Musk'un sosyal medya şirketi tarafından, milyarderin şu anda X olarak adlandırılan firmayı devralmasından bu yana platformda nefret söyleminde artış olduğunu bildirmesinin ardından dava edildi. Dava reddedildi ancak temyiz bekleniyor. Cuma akşamı BBC Haber Kanalı'na konuşan Bay Ahmed şunları söyledi: \"Birkaç yıl önce Elon Musk tarafından bize dava açıldı, ancak başarısızlıkla sonuçlandı; bir mahkeme onun hesap verebilirlik çalışmalarımızı susturmak için yasaları kullanarak ifade özgürlüğüne ilişkin İlk Değişiklik haklarımızı ihlal etmeye çalıştığını tespit etti.\" Bay Ahmed, son birkaç günün \"oldukça kafa karıştırıcı\" olduğunu söyledi. Dijital Nefretle Mücadele Merkezi'nin \"hem Cumhuriyetçi hem de Demokrat yönetimlerle çalıştığını\" ve grubunun araştırdığı kuruluşların anılmasından hoşlanmaması nedeniyle artık hedef alındığını hissettiğini söyledi. Hatta belki bazı teknoloji şirketlerinin, sosyal medya platformlarının, Dijital Nefretle Mücadele Merkezi'nin araştırdığı ve sorumlu tuttuğu yapay zeka platformlarının kışkırttığı bir hata bile olabilir.\"",

MRI Software'den alınan verilere göre, öğleden sonra 3:00 itibarıyla Birleşik Krallık'taki ana caddelere ziyaretler 2024'e göre %1,5 düşerken alışveriş merkezlerine %0,6 düşüş görüldü. MRI'ın ziyaretçi sayısı verileri, perakende parklarını geçen yıla kıyasla %6,7 daha fazla insanın ziyaret ettiğini gösterdi, ancak bu artış şu ana kadar ziyaretçilerde genel veya önemli bir artış görecek kadar büyük değil. Barclays, alışveriş yapanların satışlarda 2024'teki satışlar için tahmin ettikleri 4,6 milyar £'a göre 3,6 milyar £ harcama yapmasını bekliyor; geçen yıla göre daha az insan pazarlık yapmayı planlıyor. Çevrimiçi harcanan miktarın da düşmesi bekleniyor. İnsanlar hala alışverişe gidiyor olsa da rakamlar, Noel'in ertesi günü satışlarının eskisi kadar büyük bir olay olmadığını gösteriyor. Barclays tüketici harcamaları raporu, alışveriş yapmayı planlayanların geçen yıla kıyasla bütçelerini 17 £ artırdıklarını ancak genel olarak insanların bu yıl Noel'in ertesi günü satışlarına geçen yıla göre daha az harcama yapacaklarının tahmin edildiğini gösteriyor. Barclays perakende müdürü Karen Johnson, tüketicilerin yıl boyunca maliyet konusunda bilinçli olduklarını ve bu davranışın Noel ertesi satışlarına da yansıyacağını söyledi. 'Bastırılmış atmosfer' Ancak Glasgow'dan bir müşteri, daha hafif Noel ertesi atmosferini tercih ettiğini söyledi. BBC'ye \"Herkes bunu kendi hızına göre yapıyor, Noel'in ertesinde alışveriş yapmak daha keyifli bir deneyim sanırım\" dedi. Festival dönemi birçok perakendeci için yılın sakin dönemlerini telafi etme fırsatı olsa da Next, John Lewis, Poundland, Wickes ve İzlanda da dahil olmak üzere birçok büyük marka Noel'in ertesinde mağazalarını kapattı. Glasgow'daki başka bir müşteri, her yıl sadece ailesinin geleneği olduğu için dışarı çıktığını söyledi. \"Kesinlikle normalden çok daha sessiz\" diye fark etti, \"gerçi bu yıl Lush'ta çok büyük bir kuyruk vardı.\" Rendle Intelligence and Insights'ın CEO'su Diane Wehrle, 2025'in birçok insan için zorlu bir yıl olduğunu söyledi. BBC'ye şöyle konuştu: \"Noel'e yaklaşırken tüketiciler, özellikle Kasım ayındaki Bütçe öncesi çok gergin oldukları için harcamalarını gerçekten geri çektiler.\" Şansölye Rachel Reeves, son bütçesinde 2029-30'da 26 milyar £'a kadar vergi artışı olacağını duyurdu; bu artış, OBR'ye göre Birleşik Krallık'ın vergi gelirini 2030-31'de milli gelirin %38'i gibi tüm zamanların en yüksek seviyesine çıkaracak. Enflasyonun (fiyatların yükselme hızı) son yıllarda görülen zirvelerden düşmesine rağmen inatla yüksek kalması nedeniyle bu, hane halkı bütçelerinin daha da sıkılması anlamına geliyor. İşverenler açısından, daha yüksek asgari ücret maliyetleri ve geçen yıl açıklanan Ulusal Sigorta primleri, büyümenin yavaş olduğu bir ekonomide daha yüksek maliyetlerle karşı karşıya kalacakları anlamına geliyor. Visa'dan alınan ayrı bayram harcama verileri, Noel'e yaklaşırken harcamaların genel olarak yalnızca marjinal bir artış gösterdiğini, elektronik harcamalarının geçen yılın aynı dönemine göre %8,4 arttığını gösterdi. Ulusal İstatistik Ofisi'nin Kasım ayı resmi perakende harcama verileri de birçok alışverişçinin Kara Cuma indirimlerinin ve Noel satış kampanyalarının başlamasının cazibesine direndiğini gösterdi. Ancak Bayan Wehrle, Noel öncesi indirimlerin yaygınlaşması ve çevrimiçi alışverişteki patlamanın, Noel ertesi satışlarının son birkaç yılda \"gerçekten daha az önemli hale geldiği\" anlamına geldiğini söyledi.",

Minimum aksama beklense de, Çarşamba günü İngiltere'de 335.000'den fazla insanın uçacağı öngörülüyor; bu rakam, 2024 Noel Arifesine göre %5 artışla. RAC, Britanya yollarının kayıtların başlamasından bu yana en yoğun Noel arifelerinden birini görmesinin beklendiğini belirtirken, başka bir otomotiv lobisi bu sezondaki trafik zirvelerinin geride kaldığını söylüyor. RAC, Çarşamba günü seyahat için en kötü zamanın 13:00 ile 19:00 arası olduğunu, milyonlarca kişinin Perşembe günü Noel Günü'nden önce evlerine dönmek için yola çıktığını ve ana rotalarda gecikmelerin beklendiğini söyledi. Manchester havaalanı, Noel arifesinde yaklaşık 75.000 yolcunun geçmesini beklediğini ve 208 uçuşun İngiltere'den ayrıldığını, ancak bu sayının Noel Günü yarıya düşeceğini söyledi. Noel arifesinde en popüler destinasyonlar Amsterdam, Paris ve Dublin'dir. Bu arada Heathrow, Noel Günü'nde 152.000 yolcunun kullanması da dahil olmak üzere şimdiye kadarki en yoğun Aralık dönemini beklediğini söyledi. EasyJet, \"şimdiye kadarki en yoğun bayram sezonunun\" bir parçası olan Noel Günü'nde 558 uçuşun kalkacağını söyledi. Bu arada Stansted Havaalanı Noel Günü'nün nispeten sessiz olacağını söyledi. Bayram döneminin uçak yolculuğu açısından en yoğun günü 19 Aralık Cuma günü oldu. Getty Images Bu arada RAC, yollardaki özellikle dar noktaların sabah ortasından itibaren M25'in saat yönündeki kuzey ve batı bölümleri ve öğleden sonra Gloucestershire'dan Batı Midlands'e doğru M5 kuzeyi olacağını söyledi. Milyonlarca kişi demiryoluyla seyahat edecek olsa da, son tren seferlerinin daha erken olması birçok kişinin karayoluna yönelebileceği anlamına geliyor ve bu da onları daha da sıkışık hale getiriyor. Noel döneminde bakım nedeniyle birçok demiryolu güzergahı kısıtlanacak veya kapatılacak. Ulusal Demiryolu trenleri Noel Günü'nde çalışmamaktadır ve Noel'in ertesi gününde yalnızca küçük bir sayı çalışacaktır. National Express otobüsleri Noel gününde 96 noktaya sefer düzenlendiğini söylüyor. RAC'ın mobil servis ve onarım ekip lideri Nick Mullender, 2025'in 2013'te \"kayıtlarımızın başlamasından bu yana en yoğun kaçış dönemi gibi göründüğünü\" söyledi. Bu yılki Noel Arifesinin, işçilerin yıllık izin günlerinden tasarruf edip son dakikada kaçamaklara gitmesiyle en yoğun olacağını söyledi. Bu arada Birleşik Krallık genelinde trafik güncellemeleri sağlayan AA, 19 Aralık'ın sezonun en yoğun kısmı olduğunu söyledi. Noel Arifesi için, M27 otoyolunun, 9. Kavşak (Whiteley/Park Gate) ve 11. Kavşak (Fareham East/Gosport) arasında, 10. Kavşaktaki büyük çalışmalar nedeniyle 4 Ocak günü saat 20.00'den 04.00'e kadar her iki yönde kapanacağı konusunda uyardı. Bu kapatma, Southampton ve Portsmouth arasındaki karayolu yolculuklarını etkileyecektir. Sürücülere lastikleri kontrol etmeleri, gecikmeleri beklemeleri ve yağ ve soğutma sıvısı seviyelerinin doğru olduğundan emin olmaları tavsiye ediliyor. Havaların soğumasıyla birlikte arızaların artması ve yollarda 4,2 milyon yolculuk yapılması bekleniyor. Yolda havanın Noel seyahat planlarınızı nasıl etkileyeceğini görebilirsiniz.

Petrol devi, otomobiller, motosikletler ve endüstriyel araçlara yönelik madeni yağlar üreten Castrol'ün yüzde 65 hissesini New York merkezli Stonepeak'e sattı. Anlaşmada Castrol'e 10,1 milyar dolar (7,5 milyar £) değer biçildi ve BP, borçlarını ödemek ve ana işine odaklanmasına olanak sağlamak için kullanacağı 6 milyar dolar nakit aldı. BP, ilk kez 2000 yılında kontrolünü ele geçirdiği Castrol'ün %35 hissesini elinde tutacak. Londra merkezli petrol devi, satışın işini elden geçirme ve maliyetleri azaltma planlarında bir \"dönüm noktası\" olduğunu söyledi. BP, Şubat ayında, ana ham petrol ve gaz işine odaklanmak ve bilançosunu güçlendirmek amacıyla 20 milyar dolar (15 milyar £) değerindeki varlığını satmayı planladığını duyurdu. Bugünkü anlaşma ve önceki duyuruların ardından şirket, bu hedefe ulaşma yolunda yarıdan fazla yol kat edildiğini açıkladı. Şirket ayrıca, kârının ve hisse fiyatlarının rakiplerinin gerisinde kalmasından rahatsız olan bazı yatırımcıların baskısını takiben stratejisini yeşil enerji yatırımından uzaklaştırıyor ve petrol ve gaza olan odağını yeniliyor. Rakipleri Shell ve Norveçli şirket Equinor da yeşil enerjiye yatırım planlarını azalttı ve ABD Başkanı Donald Trump'ın \"bebek sondajı\" çağrısı, firmaları fosil yakıtlara yatırım yapmaya teşvik etti. Castrol satışı, BP'nin Nisan 2026'da yönetime geçecek ilk kadın genel müdürü Meg O'Neill'i açıklamasından bir hafta sonra gerçekleşti. Onun sürpriz ataması, BP'nin Albert Manifold adında yeni bir başkan atamasından yalnızca üç ay sonra gerçekleşti. Ve Murray Auchincloss'un Bernard Looney'den CEO olarak görevi devralmasından iki yıldan kısa bir süre sonra en üst düzey görev kendisine verildi. Çarşamba günkü anlaşma, firmanın ABD kara rüzgar enerjisi işi ile Hollanda mobilite ve rahatlık kolunun devredilmesini de içeren bir dizi satışın sonuncusu oldu. Geçici CEO Carol Howle, satışın \"tüm paydaşlar için çok iyi bir sonuç\" olduğunu söyledi. \"Karmaşıklığı azaltıyoruz, alt kısımdaki önde gelen entegre işlerimize odaklanıyoruz ve planımızın uygulanmasını hızlandırıyoruz\" diye ekledi. AJ Bell'in yatırım direktörü Russ Mould, anlaşmanın BP hissedarları için \"erken bir Noel hediyesi\" olduğunu söyledi. \"İşlemden elde edilecek önemli gelir, BP'nin külfetli borç yığınında önemli bir ilerleme kaydetmesine olanak tanıyacak. Bu aynı zamanda 2027 yılına kadar 20 milyar dolar değerindeki tasfiye hedefine ulaşma yolunda da iyi yolda olduğu anlamına geliyor\" dedi.

      "summary_tr": "İronik bir şekilde, 2019'dan beri CEO olarak görev yaptığı Fox Corp'taki başarılı liderliği (2023'te babasının fahri başkan olmasıyla Fox'un ve ayrıca News Corp'un başkanı oldu), anlaşmayı daha maliyetli hale getirdi. The Successor: The High-Stakes Life of Lachlan Murdoch'un yazarı araştırmacı gazeteci Paddy Manning'e göre, Rupert Murdoch'un 70 yıllık kariyeri onu \"hem müdahaleci bir genel yayın yönetmeni hem de politik belirleyici\" olarak görüyordu.",
      "summary_tr_long": "Rivalries and rumours: How the new order of the Murdoch dynasty is playing out Katie Razzall Culture and Media Editor BBC Listen to this article Christmas is a time when families get together if they can - and, until this year, the Murdochs were no different. With members of the media dynasty spread across the globe, full family gatherings were rare, although in 2008, according to biographer Michael Wolff, the Murdochs spent the festive season together on a flotilla of private yachts. Money doesn't compensate for a father who, in his mid-90s, decided to rip his family apart because he believed it was in the interests of his business. The Murdochs have never been a traditional family - one reason why their story is said to have inspired the power struggles and backstabbing in the acclaimed TV drama, Succession. And as one person put it to me, the TV show concluded too early by killing off Logan Roy: there was more drama to come. Earlier this year, he described his dad as a \"misogynist\" in an interview in US magazine The Atlantic, and referred to some of Rupert's behaviour in the courtroom fight as \"twisted\". Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images James Murdoch's relationship with his father Rupert and older brother Lachlan now appears irreconcilable (L-R, James Murdoch, Anna Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch) Lachlan, who Rupert had already chosen to run the business, is now - definitively - the only one who will take the reins after his father's demise. The trust had been set up in 1999, when Rupert divorced Anna, the mother of Lachlan, Elisabeth and James. Ironically, his successful leadership of Fox Corp, where he's been CEO since 2019 (he became chairman of Fox and also News Corp in 2023 when his father became chairman emeritus), made the deal more costly. Their father turned 94 in March, with the court battle in full swing. Fox Corp may operate out of the US, but he is said to prefer the laid-back nature of Australian life, even if the trade-off is business calls in the middle of the night because of the time difference, as well as a lot of flights. He's never going to want to say, 'Hey, that's me,' and so I think it's a little hard to come out from Dad's shadow.\" At the same time, Rodney Benson, professor of media, culture, and communication at New York University, says that while Rupert remains a presence in the company \"what's really unique about Lachlan's approach, or what will be unique about his approach, won't fully emerge\". In September, US President Donald Trump said Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch were expected to be part of a group of investors trying to buy TikTok in the US. On Thursday, TikTok parent company ByteDance announced to staff that it had signed an agreement to sell a portion of TikTok to a group of mostly US based investors. Reuters Under Lachlan Murdoch's leadership, the company has pursued a strategy centred on digital and streaming growth Presenting the Fox Corporation's results for July to September, Lachlan said Tubi had achieved rapid revenue growth and growth in view time, confirming its position as the top premium advertising-based video-on-demand platform in the US. Rupert Murdoch's 70-year career saw him as \"both an interventionist editor-in-chief figure and a political kingmaker\", according to Paddy Manning, an investigative journalist who wrote The Successor: The High-Stakes Life of Lachlan Murdoch. From digital real estate to sports betting to commercial radio to Tubi, Lachlan's investment decisions are focused on the bottom line, not burnishing his political credentials.\" But Prof Benson suggests the significant debt the Murdoch businesses have taken on as part of the settlement with Lachlan's siblings increases pressure to make profit, and therefore to pursue \"politically sensationalistic… outrage journalism\". Rupert's been described to me, at 94, as still \"the sharpest person in the room\" and a \"phenomenon who loves papers and has ink in his veins\". AFP via Getty Images Rupert Murdoch recently attended a state banquet at Windsor Castle as a guest of US President Donald Trump At one point the editor of the Times introduced Rupert to a slightly startled young journalist on the newsdesk and asked him to show the boss the paper's recently launched Live app and what it showed around reader engagement on specific stories. Presciently, Anna Murdoch - Lachlan, James and Elisabeth's mother - predicted much of the fallout back in the 1980s. Getty Images Anna Murdoch, the mother of Lachlan, James and Elisabeth, warned that family divisions could emerge (L - R, Lachlan, James, Rupert, Elisabeth and Anna) A decade after it was published - by which time the pair had divorced and Rupert had married third wife Wendi Deng - Anna gave an interview to an Australian women's magazine, during which she was asked which of her children would be best suited to take over from her ex-husband.

ABD hükümetinin kapatılması nedeniyle ertelenen rapor, ticaret ve göç politikalarındaki dramatik değişikliklerin yanı sıra ısrarcı enflasyon ve hükümet harcamalarındaki kesintilerle sarsılan bir ekonomiye ışık tutuyor. Ancak bu, ithalat ve ihracat gibi bazı alanlarda keskin dalgalanmalara yol açsa da, temel ekonomi sağlam ivmeyi koruyarak birçok tahminin üzerinde performans gösterdi. Bank of America kıdemli ekonomisti Aditya Bhave, \"Bu, temelde 2022'nin başından bu yana felaket ve kasvetli beklentilere meydan okuyan bir ekonomi\" dedi. BBC'nin Business Today programına konuşan Bay Bhave, ekonomiyi \"çok çok dayanıklı\" olarak nitelendirdi. \"Bunun neden ilerlemeye devam etmediğini anlamıyorum\" diye ekledi. Yılın üçüncü çeyreğine ilişkin genel büyüme rakamı beklenenden çok daha güçlüydü; çoğu analist yıllık yaklaşık %3,2 oranında bir büyüme bekliyordu. Hanehalklarının sağlık hizmetlerine daha fazla harcama yapması nedeniyle, yavaşlayan iş piyasasına rağmen önceki çeyrekte yüzde 2,5 olan tüketici harcamalarının yıllık yüzde 3,5 oranında artması bu artışı destekledi. Büyümeye karşı sayılan ithalat, Başkan Donald Trump'ın bu baharda açıkladığı ABD'ye giren sevkiyatlara uygulanan vergi dalgasının yansımasıyla düşmeye devam etti. Bu arada keskin bir şekilde düşen ihracat %7,4 oranında artarak toparlandı. Hükümet harcamaları da savunma harcamalarının etkisiyle toparlandı. Bu kazanımlar, fikri mülkiyet de dahil olmak üzere iş yatırımlarındaki yavaşlamanın ve hala yüksek olan faiz oranlarının ağırlığı altında mücadele eden konut piyasasının karşılanabilirlik sorunlarını ve arz kısıtlamalarını arttırmasına yardımcı oldu.

Trump, sosyal medyadaki bir gönderide rakamları kutladı ve sorumlunun kendi tarifeleri olduğunu söyledi. Tüketici güveninin bozulması ve anketlerin ekonomiyi yönetme konusundaki memnuniyetsizliğini göstermesi nedeniyle savunmada kaldı. Ancak bazı analistler, bazı hane halkının karşı karşıya olduğu artan fiyatların, son çeyrekte görülen alışılmadık derecede güçlü büyüme hızının sürdürülmesini zorlaştırabileceği konusunda uyardı. Rapora göre, Eylül ayına kadar olan üç aylık dönemde, Fed'in tercih ettiği enflasyon göstergesi olan kişisel tüketim harcamaları fiyat endeksi, önceki çeyrekteki %2,1'e kıyasla %2,8 arttı. Analistler, yüksek gelirli hanelerin serbestçe harcama yapmaya devam etmesine rağmen bu fiyat artışlarının düşük ve orta gelirli haneler üzerinde baskı oluşturduğu konusunda uyardı.

Konut sakinlerinin temsilcileri, herhangi bir yanıcı maddenin yerinde bırakılmasının, onarımlardan sonra bile daha düşük bir yangın güvenliği derecesine yol açabileceğinden korkuyor. Bu da bina sigortası primlerinin kalıcı olarak yükselmesine neden olabilir. Yapılan açıklamada hükümet, binaların güvenli olduğu onaylandıktan sonra primleri düşürmenin sigorta sektörüne bağlı olduğunu söyledi.

      "summary_tr_long": "Government waters down inheritance tax plan for farms Kate Whannel, political reporter, Georgia Roberts, Derby political reporter and Joe Pike, politics investigations correspondent PA Media Farmers protested against the changes again at last month's Budget Government proposals to tax inherited farmland have been watered down, with the planned threshold increasing from £1m to £2.5m. The climbdown follows months of protests by farmers and concern from some Labour backbenchers. At last year's Budget, ministers said they would start imposing a 20% tax on inherited agricultural assets worth more than £1m from April 2026, ending the 100% tax relief that had been in place since the 1980s. In an announcement put out after MPs had left Parliament for the Christmas recess, Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds said: \"We have listened closely to farmers across the country and we are making changes today to protect more ordinary family farms.\" \"It's only right that larger estates contribute more, while we back the farms and trading businesses that are the backbone of Britain's rural communities, \" she said. Head of the National Farmers' Union Tom Bradshaw welcomed the change, telling BBC Radio 5 Live it \"takes out many family farms from the eye of a pernicious storm\". Gavin Lane, president of the Country Land and Business Association, said: \"The government deserves credit for recognising the flaws in the original policy and changing course. \"Many family businesses will own enough expensive machinery and land to be valued above the threshold, yet still operate on such narrow profit margins that this tax burden remains unaffordable.\" Ben Ardern, a farmer from Derbyshire, told the BBC said it was \"a step in the right direction\". \"The big corporations who have just buried money into land - they're not farmers, they have just done it to avoid tax. Farmers haven't bought land to avoid tax, we've bought land to farm it and grow food.\" Ben Ardern, a third generation beef and dairy farmer from Buxton, has organised protests against the tax In the 14 months since the initial proposal was announced, there have been regular protests by farmers outside Parliament. At a recent parliamentary vote on the plan, a dozen backbenchers abstained and one, Markus Campbell-Savours, voted against. Campbell-Savours was subsequently suspended for voting against the government, meaning he now sits as an independent MP. John Whitby, a Labour MP from the Rural Research Group of backbenchers, said the government's climbdown on inheritance tax was \"fantastic news\". They added that many MPs would be annoyed as \"they were made to vote for it so recently\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said in a post on social media: \"This fight isn't finished. \"Other family businesses are still affected by Labour's tax raid, and we will keep pushing until the tax is lifted from them too.\" Liberal Democrat spokesperson Tim Farron MP said: \"It is utterly inexcusable that family farmers have been put through over a year of uncertainty and anguish since the government first announced these changes. \"We demand that the government scraps this unfair tax in full and if they refuse to, Liberal Democrats will submit amendments in the new year to bring it down.\" Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice said: \"This cynical climbdown - whilst better than nothing - does little to address the year of anxiety that farmers have faced in planning to protect their livelihoods... with British agriculture hanging by a thread, the government must go further and abolish this callous farms tax.\" In her first Budget in 2024, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced she would be reversing the 100% inheritance tax relief on agricultural assets that had been in place since the 1980s. The move would have seen inherited agricultural assets worth over £1m taxed at 20%, half the standard inheritance tax rate, raising an estimated £520m annually by 2029. The government had argued that the change would protect smaller farms while stopping wealthy investors from buying farmland as a tax loophole. However, it has now stepped back from the original proposal raising the threshold level to £2.5m. Coupled with an exemption which allows farmers to pass on assets to their spouses tax-free, this new government concession means a couple could pass on up to £5m in qualifying assets, without paying tax. Above the threshold, a 50% relief will be applied to the remaining assets. According to the government, the number of estates in the UK expected to pay more inheritance tax in 2026/27 will be reduced from around 2,000 under the original plans to 1,100 under the new proposal. A Treasury source said changing the thresholds would cost the government £130m, but that there were \"no plans\" for the policy to be scrapped entirely. \"It's right that the wealthiest estates pay their fair share, but smaller farms will get help.\" The climbdown is the latest in a series of U-turns the government has made since being elected in July 2024. Earlier this year the government eased cuts to winter fuel payments and backtracked on plans to make £5bn of cuts to the welfare bill.",

Elliott can't come into our house, it's as if he's been ostracised from his own home.'' The couple are among more than 300 people who have contacted the BBC in recent weeks to tell us about insulation that has gone wrong in their homes. The Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said it was taking action to ensure consumers are no longer let down by poor installations. It spread under internal wall insulation which was installed in 2024. Mr and Mrs Wadley got a government grant to have energy efficiency measures fitted in their Gower Peninsula house because they hoped a warmer home would help Elliott's asthma. Elliott, 19, hasn't entered the house since April, instead staying with his grandmother during university breaks. Billions of pounds of public money has been spent on insulating homes over the last 15 years. The Wadleys' home was insulated under a government scheme known as ECO4. In October, the National Audit Office (NAO) spending watchdog found that 98% of homes fitted with external wall insulation under ECO4 and the Great British Insulation Scheme since 2022 had major issues that needed to be repaired. It added that 29% of homes that had internal wall insulation fitted under the schemes had major issues. DESNZ said it had \"inherited a flawed system of oversight and regulation\". A spokesman for the department said it was \"committed to introducing comprehensive reforms through the Warm Homes Plan to ensure that consumers get the quality installations they deserve and failures like these are not repeated\". The spokesman added: \"People should not be expected to navigate a complex web of organisations when they want to improve their homes – and with this government, they won't.\" Becs Wadley Becs and Tony Wadley with their three sons Felix, Freddie and Elliott. The installer, Stellar Energy, says it has ''no record of any immediate safety hazards being flagged.'' It says the descriptions of the exposed wires and sockets was \"highly inconsistent\" with their standard operating procedures, which required all such work to be made safe. Building surveyor, David Walter, says the insulation wasn't fitted correctly and says the installer ''didn't understand what they were doing and what they were doing to the building which is why we've got these problems.'' Stellar Energy told the BBC the design was ''technically correct for a stone house and was installed...in strict accordance with the mandatory technical specifications of ECO4.'' Mr Wadley says he wouldn't have signed up for the grant if he'd known what would happen. Somebody needs to take responsibility.'' Stellar Energy says it ''sincerely regrets any distress this situation has caused the family'' and says its priority is ''providing a final resolution to ensure the home meets the high standards'' it strives for. Scott Proudman had external wall insulation fitted to his family's home in 2021 under a government scheme. He is facing a £20,000 bill to get it replaced. Scott Proudman contacted the BBC about the botched external wall insulation fitted to his Bristol home in 2021. Born 24 weeks premature, she has cerebral palsy, a partial visual impairment and was recently diagnosed with autism. When the work was done, insulation boards were fixed to the outside of the house and render was applied to make it waterproof. He says rainwater will very likely get under the cracked render and behind the insulation and will likely cause dampness inside. Mr Walter says all of the render and insulation will have to come off and will cost tens of thousands of pounds to put right. Right now the family is stuck with the repair bill because the installer, SPMS Wales, is being liquidated and Mr Proudman says they weren't given the required guarantee for the work. Trustmark, the organisation responsible for overseeing quality, told Mr Proudman it couldn't help because the company is no longer accredited. I can't believe how few rights consumers have.'' Brett Langdon, a director at SPMS Wales says he is ''very sorry the Proudmans have ended up in this situation'' and says all works ''were done to the manufactures specification.'' He says he gave a guarantee to the Proudmans but has told the BBC he can't remember who the guarantee is with. In a statement TrustMark said it was ''very sorry to hear about what's happened to Mr and Mrs Proudman and Mr and Mrs Wadley and the conditions both families' homes have been left in. It is totally unacceptable and we are in discussions with the relevant Scheme Providers and guarantee providers to help resolve these situations.'' And it said it underlined ''the need for reform to the current system''.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Danielle Kaye Business reporter Reuters The high-stakes search for a new leader of the US central bank is drawing to a close. US President Donald Trump is expected to name someone in the coming weeks to replace Jerome Powell, whose term as Federal Reserve chairman will end in May. That person will step into the role at a tricky moment. The bank is contending with both political pressure and internal disagreement about how it should set interest rates in the months ahead. Trump has made clear he wants lower borrowing costs and put unusual pressure on the Fed, raising questions about whether whoever wins the post will act independently. Trump's nominee would then go to the Senate for confirmation. Kevin Hassett, a Trump loyalist Reuters Kevin Hassett, a long-time conservative economist and key Trump economic adviser, is seen as a top contender to succeed Powell. A Trump loyalist, Hassett, 63, served as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during Trump's first term and now leads the National Economic Council. His odds of clinching the role have dropped since early December, but Wall Street traders still deem him the most likely choice. Hassett has been a stalwart defender of Trump's economic policies, downplaying data showing signs of weakness in the US economy and repeating allegations of bias at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. His allegiance to the president has drawn questions from analysts about whether he would act independently at the Fed and how much sway he would have with other members of the board. In a research note, Deutsche Bank economists wrote that Hassett might struggle, at least initially, to convince other policymakers to put aside concerns about inflation and cut rates meaningfully. \"Other officials might be sceptical of forward-looking arguments that rely heavily on the administration's policies bringing inflation closer to target,\" they wrote. Even some within the Trump administration have reportedly questioned whether Hassett has the skills needed to effectively take the helm of the central bank. Hassett addressed those questions in a CNBC interview this month, saying that the Fed's independence was \"really, really important\", while reiterating that interest rates still had room to fall. \"The way you've got to drive interest-rate movements is with consensus based on the facts and the data,\" he said. Kevin Warsh, a Fed critic Bloomberg via Getty Images Kevin Warsh, who served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, has re-emerged in recent weeks as another potential pick. The 55 year-old economist, a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution who serves on the board of UPS, had also been considered for Fed chair during Trump's first term. He briefly overtook Hassett in prediction markets this month before falling back to second place. \"I think the two Kevins are great,\" Trump told the Wall Street Journal this month. Warsh has been an outspoken Fed critic, lambasting everything from the central bank's heavy reliance on data to its use of assets on its balance sheet. He has escalated his rhetoric since emerging as a contender for the top Fed job this year, calling for \"regime change\". Warsh had a relatively \"hawkish\" reputation as Fed governor, meaning that he tended to favour higher interest rates and focused on concerns about inflation. But he is now seen as a voice that would support lower rates in the near term. He has argued that the Fed should shrink its balance sheet in order to bring down short-term interest rates, though some have questioned that logic. \"He thinks you have to lower interest rates,\" Trump told the Journal. \"And so does everybody else that I've talked to.\" Warsh also has close family connections to Trump's orbit. His father-in-law, billionaire businessman Ronald Lauder, is a longtime Trump donor and ally. Christopher Waller, an Fed insider Bloomberg via Getty Images Christopher Waller, a current Fed governor, recently met with Trump for an interview, boosting his chances for the job in prediction markets. He was nominated to the Fed's board by Trump in 2020 and has recently stressed that the Fed has room to lower interest rates even further. Waller, 66, lacks the personal ties that could help propel Hassett and Warsh to the top of Trump's list. Wall Street, however, has looked favourably upon his relative distance from the White House. Trump, when asked about Waller following their meeting, called him \"great\", adding that \"he's a man who's been there a long time\". While the two Kevins remain the favourites, Waller is emerging as \"the more sensible choice\", said Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital. He noted that choosing Waller could open up two spots on the Fed board for Trump to fill next year, since Fed governor Stephen Miran's term is set to end. Other names floated include BlackRock executive Rick Reider and even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. In the end, no matter who emerges the winner from this contest, it may be Wall Street that serves as final judge of their success.",

Turizm, bu Balkan ülkesinin ekonomisinin beşte birinden fazlasını oluşturuyor ve yaz aylarının dışında daha fazla ziyaretçinin gelmesini teşvik etmek istiyor. Bir zamanlar sadece güneş ve deniz vardı, ama şimdi Hırvatistan ülkenin dört bir yanında pek çok turizm ürünü sunuyor.\" Başkentin Noel pazarları ve etkinliklerinin toplu olarak bilindiği şekliyle Zagreb Advent, komşu ülkelerdeki insanları katılmaya çağıran reklam panolarıyla bu yaklaşımın poster çocuğudur. Bazı şehirler tekliflerini tek bir konumla sınırlayabilirken, Zagreb Advent merkezin büyük bir kısmını kaplayan çok mekanlı bir gösteridir. \"Tüm şehir, tüm yıl boyunca Noel'i kutlamak için bir şenlik alanı haline geldi. Noel pazarı alanlarından birini yöneten Slavica Olujic Klapcic, \"Aralık ayında\" diyor ve şöyle devam ediyor: \"Burayı gerçekten özel kılan şey, her bir mekanın kendi temasına sahip olması ve hem dekorasyon hem de sunduğu içerik açısından biraz farklı olması. Yani bir ziyaretçi için bunun iyi bir anlaşma olduğunu düşünüyorum, çünkü Zagreb'de yürüyüş yaparak pek çok farklı nokta görebilirsiniz.\" Avrupa'daki diğer Noel pazarlarında olduğu gibi sosis ve sıcak şarap gibi olağan mevsimlik temel ihtiyaç maddeleri konusunda bir sıkıntı yaşanmıyor. Ancak aynı zamanda çok sayıda müzik sahnesi, el sanatları tezgahları, geleneksel Hırvat yemekleri sunan satıcılar, sanat enstalasyonları ve muazzam bir buz pateni pisti de var. Pazar alanlarından birini yöneten Slavica Olujic Klapcic, Zagreb'in Şehirdeki tarihi Hotel Esplanade'nin dışında Noel pazarı etkinlikleri düzenlemenin yanı sıra yakındaki Strossmayer Meydanı'nda kabaca \"oynamak\" anlamına gelen Fuliranje adlı yiyecek ve müzik pazarıyla da ilgilenen Zrinka Farina, \"Zagreb'e hayat veriyor\" diyor. \"O kadar sportif bir milletiz ki, rekabet etmeyi seviyoruz ve bir şey yaptığımızda gerçekten dünyanın en iyisi olmak istiyoruz.\" İlk kez düzenlendiği 2014 yılından bu yana Zagreb Advent'i, 2015'ten 2017'ye kadar üç yıl üst üste Avrupa'nın en iyi Noel pazarı seçildi. Yarışma, seyahat sitesi European Best Destinations tarafından düzenleniyor ve Zagreb'in başarısı, her Aralık ayında şehre gelen ziyaretçi sayısının artmasına yardımcı oldu. 2024'te bu sayı iki katından fazla artarak 245.352'ye ulaştı ve turizm kurulu şehre 100 milyon Euro (117 milyon dolar; 88 milyon £) ekonomik destek sağladığını söyledi. Zagreb Advent etkinliği şehrin merkezine yayıldı. Ancak, Avrupa'nın Noel pazarının ağır toplarına yetişmek istiyorsa Zagreb'in bu yıl 229 milyon Euro'luk bir ekonomik etkiyle dört milyon ziyaretçi çekmesi bekleniyor. Avusturya'nın başkenti Viyana, Noel pazarına yaklaşık 2,8 milyon ziyaretçi çekiyor ve Fransa'nın Strasbourg'u iki milyon insanı ağırlıyor. Zagreb'deki etkinliğin de sınırlı bir geçmişi var; aksine, dünyanın en eski Noel pazarı olarak kabul edilen Dresden'deki Noel pazarı ilk kez 1434'te kuruldu. Strazburg'unki 1570'te, Viyana 1764'te ve Köln 1820'de açıldı. Buz pateni pistinde görevli olarak çalışan Lucija Vrkljan, \"Buraya İtalya'dan, İspanya'dan, Bosna'dan, Slovenya'dan ve hatta Birleşik Krallık'tan geliyorlar\" diyor. Hotel Esplanade Noel pazarında vegan ve glutensiz yiyecekler sunan bir bistro olan BioMania'nın kurucusu Dario Kozul, \"Burası harika bir yer\" diyor. Getty Images aracılığıyla AFP Dresden'de Noel pazarı ilk kez 1434'te kuruldu Hırvatistan'daki Rijeka Üniversitesi Turizm Fakültesi Dekanı Marko Peric, Zagreb Advent'in Aralık ayında \"alışılmadık derecede yüksek\" sayıda varış ve geceleme getirdiğini kabul ediyor. Ayrıca Şubat ayındaki karnaval veya spor etkinlikleri gibi diğer etkinlikleri de kullanabiliriz.\" Turizm Bakanı Tonci Glavina, Hırvatistan'ın doğru yönde hareket ettiği konusunda ısrar ediyor. Temmuz ve Ağustos aylarındaki ziyaretçi sayılarının aslında 2024'ün aynı dönemine göre hafif bir düşüş gösterdiğine dikkat çekiyor. Ancak Haziran ve Eylül aylarında yaklaşık %5 daha fazla ziyaretçi ile yaz zirvesinin her iki tarafındaki önemli büyüme sayesinde ülke hala rekor kıran bir yıla doğru ilerliyor. Bakan bunun \"mükemmel\" olduğunu söylüyor Aralık ayının ilk haftasında yıllık %10'luk bir artış var \"Hırvatistan'ı sürdürülebilir bir turizm destinasyonu haline getiriyoruz, bu da yoğun sezonda aynı sayıda misafir anlamına geliyor, ara sezonları geliştiriyoruz ve elbette ülkenin diğer bölgelerini ana turizm destinasyonları haline getiriyoruz.\"",

Fiyatlar bir yıl öncesine göre %3,2 arttı. Sanal alışveriş çantanızı bir yıl önce 100 £ maliyetle mal ve hizmetlerle doldurduysanız, aynı seçimin maliyeti şimdi 103,20 £ olacaktır. Artan fiyat oranı İngiltere Merkez Bankası'nın hedefi olan %2'nin oldukça üzerinde ve bazı kalemlerin fiyatları hâlâ hızla artıyor. Muhtemelen Noel'de aile beslenmesinin merkezinde yer alan çikolata, bir yıl öncesine göre %17 daha pahalı. Ancak en önemlisi, artık fiyatların daha yavaş bir oranda arttığına dair açık işaretler var. Bu, gelecek yıl için iyiye işaret ve borçlanma maliyeti açısından da daha acil bir durum. Yavaşlamayı temel unsurların tetiklediği göz önüne alındığında, en son veriler, özellikle yaşam pahalılığının zorlandığını hisseden kişiler tarafından memnuniyetle karşılanacak. Makarna, şeker ve un fiyatları düşüyor Analistlere göre, yaşam pahalılığının yükselişini gösteren enflasyon oranı son dönemdeki mini zirvesini aştı. Enflasyonun en yüksek noktasına ulaştığı Ekim 2022'de oran %11,1'e ulaştı. Oran daha sonra düştü, ancak 2025 yazının sonlarında bir artış yaşandı ve %3,8'e ulaştı. Tüketiciler için vazgeçilmez bir gıda maddesi olan fiyat, Kasım ayında enflasyonun düşmesine neden oldu. Gıda ve alkolsüz içecekler Ekim ayındaki %4,9'a kıyasla Kasım ayında %4,2 arttı. Alkol ve tütün Ekim ayındaki %5,9'a kıyasla %4 arttı. Çikolata, sığır eti ve dana eti (yılda yaklaşık %28 arttı) ile ters yönde hareket eden zeytinyağı (%16 düşüş) ile un, makarna ve şeker fiyatlarındaki düşüş oldu. Fiyatlar yavaşça yükseldiğinde bu, gelirlerinin daha büyük bir kısmının onsuz yapamayacakları şeylere harcandığını gören düşük gelirliler için çok daha iyi bir haber. Yatırım şirketi Hargreaves Lansdown'un kişisel finans başkanı Sarah Coles, bunun aynı zamanda genel enflasyon oranının beklenenden daha hızlı düşmesine de yardımcı olduğunu söyledi: \"İngiltere Merkez Bankası'nın öngördüğü yolu izliyor; Eylül'de zirveye ulaşıyor ve yavaş yavaş güneye doğru ilerliyor.\" İyi haber kalıcı olacak mı? Fiyat artışlarının yavaşlamasının nedenleri genellikle bireysel kalemlere özgüdür. Örneğin, zeytinyağı fiyatındaki düşüş öncelikle Yunanistan ve Türkiye'de sıcak hava dalgaları ve kuraklıkla geçen kötü yılların ardından hasatta yaşanan toparlanmanın bir sonucudur. Giyim ve ayakkabı fiyatları Ekim ayındaki %0,3'lük artışa kıyasla Kasım ayında %0,6 düştü. Bu durum, alışveriş yapanların yaşam maliyeti baskısıyla boğuşması nedeniyle mağazaların zayıf satışlar nedeniyle Kara Cuma indirimlerini öne sürmesiyle bağlantılı. Lucy, ev yapımı fırıncıların ellerindeki imkanlardan en iyi şekilde yararlandıklarını söylüyor. Tüketicilerin de son yıllardaki finansal koşullar nedeniyle alışkanlıklarını değiştirdiğini söylüyor. Londra'nın Camberwell kentinde Band of Bakers adlı pasta paylaşım sosyal kulübünün işletilmesine yardımcı olan Lucy Fairs, son beş yılda ekstra özel malzemeler almak yerine dolaplarında zaten bulunanları kullanmaya başladıklarını söyledi. Costa Christou, tarifleri dikkatle seçtiğini söylüyor Kulüp üyesi Costa Christou, \"Bugün için bir tarif seçtiğimde temayı düşündüm - ama daha çok, kilerimde zaten bulunanları düşündüm\" dedi. Borçlanma ve tasarruf üzerindeki etki Mal ve hizmetlerin artan maliyeti, tasarruf ettiğiniz veya kazandığınız parayı etkiler. Enflasyon, biriktirdiğiniz paranın ve - maaş artışı almadığınız sürece - maaşınızın harcama gücünü aşındırır. Analistler, son enflasyon verilerinin İngiltere Merkez Bankası Para Politikası Komitesi'nin Perşembe günü faiz oranlarında indirim yapma olasılığını güçlendirdiğini söylüyor. Bu, tüketicilerin borç almasını daha ucuz hale getirecek, ancak tasarruf sahipleri için daha düşük getiri sağlayacaktır. Shawbrook Bank tasarruf yorumcusu Sally Conway, \"Enflasyonun düşük olması hanehalkı bütçeleri için iyi bir haber, ancak tasarruf sahipleri için farklı bir hikaye\" dedi. \"Bir miktar tasarruf Noel'de kaçınılmaz olarak olumsuz etkilenecektir. Ortalık yatıştığında, kalan paranın yeterince çalışıp çalışmadığını kontrol etmek faydalı olacaktır.\" Politika yapıcılar, daha fazla insanı paralarını hisse senetlerine ve hisse senetlerine yatırmaya teşvik etmeye çalışıyor ve bunun zaman içinde nakit tasarruftan daha yüksek getiri sağlayacağını söylüyorlar. Mali Davranış Otoritesi'nin, ilk kez bankaların ve finans şirketlerinin paranızı nereye yatıracakları konusunda önerilerde bulunmalarına olanak tanıyan bir program olan hedefe yönelik destek için yeşil ışık vermesinin nedeni budur.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Spain's commitment to renewable energy may be in doubt Guy Hedgecoe Aragón, north-eastern Spain Juan Antonio Domínguez Spain gets more than half of its electricity from wind and solar On the edge of the sleepy town of Figueruelas, a single, vast wind turbine spins around, casting its shadow over the buildings nearby. It's a reminder of the importance of renewable electricity in this windswept area of Aragón, in north-eastern Spain, whose plains are host to many of the country's wind and solar energy farms. Figueruela's status as a symbol of Spain's green transition has been further boosted recently, as work starts nearby on the construction of a vast factory that will produce batteries for electric vehicles. Chinese firm CATL and the Netherlands-based Stellantis are investing a combined €4bn ($4.7bn; £3.5bn) in the facility. \"We're in Aragón, where there's wind all year round, there are lots of hours of sunshine, and we are surrounded by wind turbines and solar panels,\" he says. \"Those [energy sources] will be crucial in generating electricity for the new factory, and I understand that was the key reason for building it here in Figueruelas.\" Luis Bertol Moreno says the new battery factory will transform the town of Figueruelas The factory can be seen as vindication of Spain's energy model, which prioritises renewable sources. In 2017, renewables contributed just a third of Spain's electricity production, but last year they represented 57%. By 2030, the government wants them to contribute 81% of electricity output. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez summarised his government's approach as he delivered a riposte to US President Donald Trump's pro-fossil fuel \"Dig, baby, dig\" slogan. This was in great part due to an 28 April blackout that left homes, businesses, government buildings, public transport, schools and universities in the dark across Spain and neighbouring Portugal for several hours. With the government unable to offer a full explanation for the outage, the country's energy mix became a fiercely-debated political issue. Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the conservative opposition, accused the government of \"fanaticism\" in pursuing its green agenda, suggesting that an over-reliance on renewables might have caused the incident. The fact that, a week before the blackout, solar generation in mainland Spain registered a record 61.5% of the electricity mix has fuelled such claims. Yet the government and national grid operator Red Eléctrica have both denied that the outage was linked to the preponderance of renewable energy sources in Spain. \"We have operated the system with higher renewable rates [previously] with no effect on the security of the system,\" says Concha Sánchez, head of operations for Red Eléctrica. \"Definitely it's not a question of the rate of renewables at that moment.\" Ms Sánchez said the blackout was caused by a combination of issues, including an \"unknown event\" in the system moments before, which saw anomalous voltage oscillations. However, Red Eléctrica and the government are still awaiting reports on the incident that they hope will determine the exact cause. Meanwhile, since April, Spain's electricity mix has been modified somewhat, with greater reliance on natural gas, reinforcing the notion that the country is at an energy crossroads. AFP via Getty Images Work on the new battery factory was officially started last month, accompanied by a press conference Spain's nuclear industry, which currently contributes around 20% of national electricity, has been particularly vocal since the blackout, pushing back against government plans to close the country's five nuclear plants between 2027 and 2035. The companies that own the Almaraz plant in south-western Spain, due to be the first to shut down, have requested a three-year extension to its life until 2030. Ignacio Araluce, president of Foro Nuclear, an association that represents the industry, says Spain is the only country in the world that is scheduling the closure of nuclear plants that are in operation. Mr Araluce praises renewable sources because they only require natural elements to generate electricity, but points out that they are not able to operate around the clock or when weather is unfavourable. The answer, he added, is \"with a source like nuclear, that is not producing CO2, that is producing all hours of the year\". The far-right Vox, criticising what it saw as a lack of explanation by the government for the April blackout, recently described nuclear power as \"a crucial source of stability\". AFP via Getty Images The current government is committed to closing the country's five nuclear power plants Ms Sánchez acknowledges that there is room for improvement for Spain's electricity model, pointing to the Iberian peninsula's relative isolation from the European grid compared to most of its EU neighbours. The Socialist-led coalition has been mired in corruption scandals and its parliamentary majority appears to have collapsed in recent weeks, raising the possibility of a snap election in the coming months. The town's population, of just 1,000, is due to increase dramatically, with 2,000 Chinese workers scheduled to arrive to help build the new battery plant, which is expected to create up to 35,000 indirect jobs once it starts operating.",

Kuzey Bransholme Toplum Merkezi'ndeki mağaza, meyve, sebze ve ekmek paketleriyle birlikte ihtiyaç fazlası yiyecekleri satıyor ve fiyatı tanesi 20 peni kadar düşük. Bölgede yaşayan, gelir testinden yararlanan ve ücretsiz üyelik için başvuran herkes tarafından kullanılabilir. Bu ayki açılış gününde yüzlerce kişi mağazayı ziyaret ederek çoğu süpermarketin ödediği fiyatın yaklaşık üçte biri karşılığında yiyecek satın aldı; patronlar bunun bir aileye ayda 200 sterlinden fazla tasarruf sağlayabileceğini tahmin ediyordu. İki çocuk annesi Kirsty Armstrong, mağazanın haftalık yiyecek dükkanı açma endişesini ortadan kaldırdığını söyledi. \"Çalışıyor olsanız bile, meyve gibi en basit şeyleri bile satın almak hâlâ gerçekten zor olabiliyor. \"Yaklaşık 6 sterlin harcadım, ekmeğim, meyvem var ve sepetimde dondurulabilecek şeyler düşünüyorum.\" James Trott, sitedeki birçok kişinin kapıdan giren ilk müşterilerden biri olan 67 yaşındaki James Trott'a fayda sağlayacağını ve dükkânı düzenli olarak kullanmayı planladığını söylüyor. \"Emekli maaşı almanın bana faydası oluyor çünkü benzininiz, elektriğiniz, suyunuz, kiranız ve belediye verginiz var. ödeme yapmak ve sitedeki yardımlardan yararlanan herkes için gerçekten çok zor\" dedi. \"60 peniye bir kutu fasulye aldım, başka bir mağazada iki katı olurdu.\" Mağaza, bir sosyal girişim olan Community Shop Group tarafından Birleşik Krallık genelinde açılan türünün 15'incisi. Ürünler, gıda endüstrisi ortakları tarafından aşırı stok veya mevsimlik paketleme nedeniyle fazla stoktan bağışlanıyor. Gary Stott, mağazanın insanları sağlıklı seçimler yapmaya teşvik ettiğini söylüyor Gary Stott, yönetici Başkan Stott, bunun Bransholme bölgesindeki insanları desteklemenin yanı sıra gıda israfıyla mücadeleye de yardımcı olduğunu söyledi: \"Gıda fazlası ortaya çıkıyor ve biz bunu yeniden etiketleyip satışa sunabiliriz\" dedi Bay Stott, \"Ortalama sepet harcamasının perakende satış fiyatının yaklaşık %30'u olduğu 600 ürün serisine sahip bir perakende mağazamız var ve böylece bir aile olarak alışveriş faturalarınızdan ayda 212 £ tasarruf edebilirsiniz. \"Küçük bir market olmamıza rağmen sepetimizin %30'u meyve ve sebzeden oluşuyor. Bu da ailelerin gelip uygun fiyata gerçekten sağlıklı seçimler yapabileceği anlamına geliyor.\" Carol Redfern, topluluk kafesinin \"çok şey ifade ettiğini\" söylüyor. Grup, mağazadan elde edilen karın, üyelerin yeni beceriler öğrenmesini desteklemeyi amaçlayan bir topluluk merkezine yeniden yatırılacağını söyledi. Bu arada, ortak bir mutfak ve kafede kahvaltı ve öğle yemeğinin yanı sıra tüm yıl boyunca ücretsiz çocuk yemekleri de 1,50 £ karşılığında satılıyor. Carol Redfern ve annesi de içeceklerin tadını çıkaranlar arasındaydı. Şöyle dedi: \"Buraya gelip kaliteli gıdayı daha ucuza alabilmek çok şey ifade ediyor. Annem benimle yaşıyor, o engelli, dolayısıyla çok fazla paramız yok. \"Buraya gelip bir şeyler yiyebilirsiniz ve çocukların bedava yemek yemesi harika.\" David Daniels, mağazanın gıda bankaları üzerindeki baskıyı azaltacağını söylüyor Yoksulluk karşıtı yardım kuruluşu Trussel'in rakamları, Yorkshire ve Humber'da geçen yıl 700.000'den fazla kişinin parasızlık nedeniyle açlıkla karşı karşıya kaldığını ve bölgede her 10 kişiden birinin \"gıda güvensizliği\" olarak sınıflandırılan evlerde yaşadığını gösteriyor. 73 yaşında olan ve engellilik yardımı alan David Daniels, sosyal mağazayı \"bu çağda bir ihtiyaç\" olarak nitelendirdi. \"Finansal olarak birçok insana yardımcı olacağını düşünüyorum\" dedi. \"İnsanlar indirimli fiyatlar ödeyebilir ve kaliteli ürünler alabilirsiniz.\"",

      "summary_tr_long": "How to get rid of unwanted Christmas presents - without being found out Richard Wilson Dawn-Maria France is an advocate for regifting and says it's the perfect way to declutter her home Most of us have received at least one Christmas present that missed the mark - a jumper that doesn't fit, a hideous ornament or a perfume you don't like. Not every present is greeted with delight - so instead of banishing them to the back of a cupboard, how can you get rid of them without causing offence? Regift Getty Images For Dawn-Maria France from North Yorkshire, the solution to unwanted gifts is simple - pass them on to someone else. She never feels any guilt for doing so and believes it is a more sustainable way of celebrating the festive season. \"It's a budget-friendly way to manage spending, especially during the cost-of-living crisis, and it's helped me declutter my home,\" she adds. Each year, an estimated £42m worth of unwanted presents are thrown away in the UK, with some ending up in landfill. Dawn-Maria re-wrapped her garden seeds adding a personalised note hinting that it was a regift. Hide the evidence Antoinette Akanji The original gifter mustn't risk crossing paths with the new recipient of the gift, says etiquette expert Antoinette Akanji's So how do you regift without causing offence? \"Don't get caught out,\" warns Louise Minchin, who presents the BBC's Rip Off Britain programme, advising regifters to remove any labels or notes that might be addressed to someone else. Before re-wrapping she recommends inspecting the gift carefully to make sure no seals have been broken or show signs of wear. \"I've been caught out,\" admits BBC Radio 2's Reverend Kate Bottley who forgot to check there wasn't a card inside a gift she passed on. The BBC's Morning Live regular Dr Oscar remembers being handed a box of chocolates with the message \"Dear Mrs Smith, Thanks for being my teacher this year\". Etiquette expert Antoinette Akanji's has another golden rule: regift outside your social circle. \"If your aunt has given you a jumper that you didn't like, do not regift this to your cousin,\" she says. \"She may see your cousin wearing it and this could provoke an awkward conversation.\" \"You need to ensure that the original giver and the new recipient aren't likely to cross paths.\" 3. Resell Kirsty Quinn Kirsty Quinn, 36 from Oxfordshire says she makes about £500 a month reselling items sourced from car boot sales and charity shops on eBay and Vinted. \"Selling unwanted gifts can help someone else get something they want at a cheaper price, which feels especially relevant given how tough the economy is at the moment,\" she adds. \"It also means the seller can put that money towards something they actually need, something that improves their life, or something they'll truly use. To me, that feels more practical and sustainable than letting items go to waste.\" Vinted says the first Sunday of each year sees a spike in listings of unwanted gifts - averaging three times the normal daily rate Last year's top-listed items women's toiletries and perfumes, jewellery, nightwear and make-up, according to the platform. Fashion dominated the most-bought items after Christmas closely followed by entertainment and electronics, Vinted says. Vinted's tips for reselling presents without offending the person who bought them include using a username that is not easily identifiable and keeping the background of photos neutral. \"Many members will however choose to regift openly, and will include phrases like 'unwanted gift' in their item description,\" a Vinted spokesperson says. \"This often helps buyers better understand the condition of the item.\" 4. Donate Getty Images If regifting doesn't feel right there are plenty of other ways to pass on the joy, says Louise. Charity shops eagerly await the post-christmas clear-out, when unwanted gifts become someone else's treasure. \"If you have decorations that didn't quite fit your theme, a board game you've been gifted twice, or a Christmas jumper that's no longer your colour, why not let them brighten someone else's home or wardrobe by donating them to us?\" And it's not about just donating - shopping in charity shops over Christmas can make a difference too. \"Our stores are full of unexpected treasures - quality items just waiting to find loving new homes,\" she says. If you're worried a relative might stumble across the item they'd bought you while they bargain hunt you can always donate to a charity shop outside of your local area. Include a gift receipt If you're the one giving the present, you can make life easier for the recipient if you include a receipt. \"If you're giving someone a gift and include a gift receipt, it gives them far more options,\" explains Louise, especially when the item is high-value. Without a receipt, things can quickly become uncomfortable, so Louise recommends an honesty first policy: \"Don't be afraid to say, 'I'm really sorry, but I'd like to exchange this for something else do you have the original receipt?'\" Other stories you may enjoy",

      "summary_tr_long": "Faisal Islam Economics editor BBC Budget days used to be symbolised by the chancellor of the exchequer smiling and holding aloft the famous Red Box outside Number 11. Now a debate is bubbling about whether this small department, known as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - and staffed mainly by young intellectuals and civil servants - is in fact too powerful, with claims from some that it is essentially half-running the government economic policy. If she wants to change the policies, she can change the policies.\" Getty Images A debate is bubbling about whether the department, known to few outside this closed world, is in fact too powerful Officially the OBR monitors the UK government's spending plans and performance, and releases forecasts for the economy and public finances twice a year, (alongside the Budget and Spring Statement), which assess whether the government is likely to meet the rules it has set over tax and spending. At the time I reported that the then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng had brushed away the offer from the OBR of an official forecast, which could either have given some comfort to the markets that the plan had been fully costed, or impeded the Truss administration's ability to announce those policy changes. WPA Pool/Getty Images The Conservatives' mini-Budget of September 2022, which promised big tax cuts but did not say how they would be paid for, spooked financial markets Empowering the OBR was, in fact, part of Rachel Reeves's plan. When I asked the chancellor about a statement from the OBR, issued two months earlier, that \"promises made are constantly not kept\" on tax and spending, Reeves replied: \"The OBR have got an important job to do and their job is to produce forecasts on the economy - not to give a running commentary on government policy.\" Office for Budget Responsibility Richard Hughes, the former Treasury mandarin, educated at Oxford and Harvard, is at the helm of the OBR Yet the message I received from that exchange with Richard Hughes was clear: the OBR's true power is not at all at the level its critics suggest. \"They are inescapably political.\" At the end of October, one month before the Budget, the OBR is understood to have lowered its forecast for productivity - a measure of the output of the economy per hour worked - by 0.3 percentage points. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, for every 0.1 percentage point downgrade in the productivity forecast, government borrowing would increase by £7bn in 2029-30 - meaning a 0.3 point cut could add £21bn to Rachel Reeves's Budget black hole. For example, if this downgrade had been given when, say, Jeremy Hunt was chancellor, it would have been far more difficult - impossible says the current Treasury - for the Conservatives to deliver the pre-election National Insurance cuts that he did in March 2024. \"A body designed to police cuts is now being asked to referee a strategy for growth, and it simply isn't built for the task.\" But Richard Hughes told me in March he was simply accounting for the numbers, and that it is the chancellor and Parliament that have £3 trillion a year worth of power to make decisions on either raising revenues or spending them. A need for 'reconstruction' In late September 2008, as the world and Britain especially was convulsed by its biggest ever financial crisis, the Conservative Party published an obscure pamphlet titled \"Reconstruction\". British building society Bradford & Bingley had just been nationalised; US investment bank Lehman Brothers had collapsed a fortnight before; and half the British banking system was being prepared for state bailouts, and the pamphlet reflected what researchers were saying was best practice in the field of fiscal policy. Getty Images US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008 The office was first established by the coalition government in 2010, then put on a permanent statutory footing in March 2011. Take the fallout after Robert Chote, then chair of the OBR, published a chart showing spending levels at their lowest since the 1930s. AFP via Getty Images Chancellor George Osborne predicted that appointing independent economists was likely going to cause the coalition government some problems Since then, the former Prime Minister Liz Truss, has made claims that a \"deep state\" played a part in bringing down her brief government - \"the economic establishment, who fundamentally don't want the status quo to change\", as she put it. Richard Hughes (left), Andy King, who was a member of the Budget Responsibility Committee of the Office for Budget Responsibility until August 2023, and David Miles (right) Richard Hughes and Tom Josephs both had senior positions in charge of fiscal policy at the Treasury, while Prof David Miles is a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee and chief economist at Morgan Stanley. Bloomberg via Getty Images By September of this year, suggestions of the Treasury's own frustration with the OBR were circulating Ultimately, the mini-Budget of 2022 showed how much the OBR's role is respected in the markets: this was stressed by the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey at emergency meetings in Downing Street at the height of that crisis.",

      "summary_tr_long": "The curious case of why Poundland is struggling during a cost-of-living crisis Emma Simpson Business correspondent BBC The residents of Peckham in south London have just lost their Poundland store, which closed this week after 11 years of trading. Rye Lane in south London - a lively, multicultural high street - is losing its pound shop, after 11 years of trading More than 100 of its shops have either shut or been earmarked for closure since the summer. That's after the business was sold in June for a nominal £1 amid \"challenging trading conditions\". It does have a turnaround plan but by the end of the process, Poundland expects to end up with between 650 and 700 shops, compared with the 800-odd it had at the start of this year. Elsewhere on UK high streets, the Original Factory shop is struggling and has shut at least 22 shops. And B&M Bargains, one of the UK's biggest discount chains, has launched a turnaround plan due to weak sales. Bloomberg via Getty Images Poundland was sold in June for a nominal £1 amid 'challenging trading conditions' All big retailers have faced a substantial increase in employer costs because of last year's Budget, but it's more difficult when you're selling the cheapest products because there's less wiggle room to absorb the extra costs, or to pass them on to customers. After inflation, selling a product for £1 in 1990, when Poundland began, is the equivalent of selling it for 40p today. The entrepreneur who cracked the model Chris Edwards, a businessman from Yorkshire, has spent more than 50 years working in retail's bargain basement. He and his son were the team behind Poundworld, which they sold for £150m 10 years ago. In 2019, they started a new chain, OneBelow, selling everything for £1 or less - but three years later they had to change tactics. It's now called OneBeyond, with almost everything at £1 or above. \"What tipped us over the edge was the [post-pandemic] shipping crisis, when we couldn't get containers through and the cost of freight was ridiculous.\" 'We realised the pound game wasn't going to work any more,' says Chris Edwards But Mr Edwards says his business model still works: in his view, it comes down to experience, negotiating skill and getting the mix of products just right. As for making economics stack up, he says sometimes he is able to secure cheap prices on UK stock from big-name brands but when he can't he sacrifices profits in order to attract shoppers. The father and son duo grew Poundworld into a chain of more than 300 shops, before selling it in 2015 to an American investor. \"They tried to sell other things but not in a controlled way like we do it.\" Wilko also lost its way, tipping into administration in 2023 with the loss of thousands of jobs. The business had drifted further and further from its original premise - lots of products for £1 - and was selling them instead at a wide range of different prices. This has meant closing 57 unprofitable stores and negotiating steep rent cuts with landlords, where it can. Another 48 shops are being shut as these landlords have decided to take back the leases and find new occupiers instead. The main budget chains now have 3,400 shops across the UK, according to data analytics firm, Geolytix. The number of them more than doubled between 2009 and 2015 - but numbers have risen only slightly since then. Back in 2009 the UK was in the teeth of a recession, following the global financial crisis. Getty High street shopping has evolved since the 1970s, when shops like Woolworths were hugely popular Discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl also grew rapidly during this period, luring millions of customers away from the established grocers with cheaper prices. By 2019, much of the budget store growth was happening in out-of-town locations and retail parks, a trend accelerated by the pandemic. Sales figures are hard to come by, but Mintel data suggests 30% of online shoppers in the UK shopped with Temu in the year to September 2025, while 14% shopped with AliExpress and 3% with DHGate, another Chinese marketplace, in the same period. AFP via Getty Images Chinese brands like Shein sell products in bulk from their huge factories - inside one of their enormous factories Amazon has also got in on the act by launching its own ultra-low-cost shopping section, Amazon Haul. So this sort of wave of low-cost influence from outside of the UK isn't slowing down, and I think there's much more to come.\" There are also new selling platforms like TikTok Shop, Catherine Shuttleworth points out, where you can find people advertising anything from sweets and toilet paper to pillows. The Range has continued to expand, opening 60 standalone stores this year, after acquiring the DIY chain Homebase out of administration. \"For some people, budget shopping is a hobby,\" she adds, \"but for others it's an absolute necessity.\" BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.",

      "summary_tr_long": "Süpermarket fiyatlarının neden çok yüksek olduğunun hikayesini anlatan 5,30 sterlinlik portakal suyu Faysal İslam Ekonomisi editörü BBC Faysal'ı dinleyin bu makaleyi okuyun İngiliz kahvaltı masalarında bardaklarda acı bir tınıdan daha fazlası var. Kafelerde ve restoranlarda da benzer bir hikaye var; bir bardak sade portakal suyu için artık standart fiyat noktası 3,50 ila 4 £ arasında. Bir meslektaşımız, Kent'teki mütevazı küçük bir restoranda akşamdan kalma bir bardak portakal suyu ve limonata için 9 sterlinlik bir fatura gönderilmesine öfkelendi. Neden bu kadar çok olduğu sorulduğunda, taze sıkılmış da olsa portakal suyunun fiyatın 5,30 sterlinini oluşturduğu söylendi. Bütün bunlar, 2023'te %17,5'e ulaştıktan sonra düşen (Ağustos'ta %5,7 civarına) ancak yeniden yükselen gıda fiyat enflasyonuyla birleşiyor. Ayrıca bugün açıklanan yeni genel enflasyon rakamları %3,8'i gösteriyor; bu da İngiltere Merkez Bankası'nın %2'lik hedefinin art arda 12. ay üzerinde olduğunu gösteriyor. Hulton Arşivi/Getty Images Konsantre portakal suyu Minute Maid tarafından ticarileştirildi. Portakal suyunun neredeyse %90'ı sudur. 2. Dünya Savaşı, askerler denemeden sona erdi, ancak sonunda Amerikan meşrubat devi Minute Maid tarafından ticarileştirildi. TV Times/ Getty Images/ Screen Archives Minute Maid portakal suyu bugüne kadar Bing Crosby Flash tarafından popüler hale getirildi ve her yıl tahminen 2,5 milyar galon portakal suyu içiliyor; bunun yaklaşık onda biri pazarın hala büyümekte olduğu Birleşik Krallık'ta. Şirketi Gerald McDonald and Co, adını o zamanlar İngiliz mandası altındaki Filistin'den 1940'lara kadar portakal konsantresi ithal eden öncü büyük büyükbabasından alıyor. Ancak fiyatlar küresel pazarlarda olağanüstü boyutlara ulaştı; son on yılda lb başına 1 dolardan (75 peni) 1,50 dolara (1,12 sterlin) yükseldi ve geçen yılın sonunda lb başına 5,30 dolara kadar rekor bir seviyeye ulaştı. \"Böylesine büyük bir emtianın 2 dolardan 7 dolara çıkması çılgınlık ama tüketicilere ulaşması biraz zaman aldı.\" Danışmanlık firması GlobalData'nın sektör uzmanı Philip Coverdale, 2023 yılına kadar portakal suyu fiyatlarındaki artışın genel olarak gıda enflasyonu altında gizlendiğini açıklıyor. (Ayrıca İspanya da, geçen Ekim ayında Valensiya'da yaşanan sel de dahil olmak üzere, hava şartlarına bağlı üretim düşüşlerinden zarar gördü.) Getty Images aracılığıyla AFP İspanya, hava şartlarından kaynaklanan üretim düşüşlerinden zarar gördü Brezilya'da bile pazar, büyük sanayileşmiş holdinglerin elinde yoğunlaşmış durumda. \"Florida'dan portakal çıkarmak [kıtlık nedeniyle] çok zor ve çok pahalı.\" VW Pics/Universal Images Group, Getty Images aracılığıyla İspanya da portakal yetiştiriyor; ancak Valensiya ve Seville portakalları konsantre yerine çoğunlukla meyve olarak ihraç ediliyor. Tropicana'nın önde gelen tedarikçilerinden biri bu yılın başlarında ev inşa etmek için arazisinin bir kısmını sattı. ABD'nin Kanada'ya portakal suyu ihracatı, Kanada'nın ABD ihracatına karşı vergi koymasının ardından 20 yılın en düşük seviyesine geriledi. Trump yönetimi aynı zamanda Brezilya'dan gelen portakal suyuna da ABD süpermarket fiyatlarını besleyecek %10'luk bir tarife üzerinde anlaştı. 2024 yılında Birleşik Krallık, İngiltere dışında yetiştirilen meyvelerden üretilen bazı ithalatlara uygulanan gümrük vergilerini kaldırdı. Getty Images Trump yönetimi Brezilya'dan gelen portakal suyuna %10 gümrük vergisi koydu. Ardından ambalajlamayla ilgili yeni düzenlemeler baskıları daha da artırıyor. Ancak bu, talebin azalmasıyla da örtüşüyor: Küresel portakal suyu tüketimi, yirmi yıl önceki zirve noktasına göre şu anda %30 azaldı. Aldi'nin Birleşik Krallık CEO'su Giles Hurley, \"Hasattaki değişkenlik azalmış gibi görünüyor\" diyor ve şöyle devam ediyor: \"Satın alma ekibimiz, tasarrufların tüketicilere aktarılmasını sağlamak için ellerinden gelen her şeyi yapıyor.\" Dondurulmuş konsantrenin büyük kısmının geçen yılın yüksek fiyatlarından satın alındığı göz önüne alındığında, tedarik zincirindeki diğer kişiler bu kadar ikna edici değil. Ulusal İstatistik Ofisi'ne göre tereyağı neredeyse %19, çikolata ve kahve %15 ve süt ise %12'nin üzerinde artış gösterdi. Perakendeciler ile üreticiler veya çiftçiler arasındaki ilişkileri ve sözleşmelerin kullanımını ortaya çıkarmak zordur.\" Ayrıca portakal suyunun çok ötesine geçen daha geniş bir soru daha var: Birleşik Krallık'taki tüketicilerin, sınırlı tarıma sahip, yoğun nüfuslu küçük bir ülke olarak, değişen iklimin Birleşik Krallık'ın gıda fiyatı şoklarına giderek daha fazla maruz kalacağı anlamına geldiği gerçeğini kabul etmesi gerekiyor mu? Gıda güvenliğine ilişkin 2024 tarihli bir hükümet raporu şunu belirtiyordu: \"Birleşik Krallık, meyve, sebze ve deniz ürünlerine yönelik tüketici talebini karşılamak için büyük ölçüde ithalata bağımlı olmaya devam ediyor... \"Birleşik Krallık'ın birçok ülkesi Bu gıdaların ithalatı iklimle ilgili kendi zorluklarına ve sürdürülebilirlik risklerine tabidir.\" Ve bu, yiyecek ve içeceklerimize ödediğimiz parayla ilgili çılgın bir yolculuğun yalnızca başlangıcı olabilir.

Arjantin'in hala IMF'ye 31 milyar sterlin borcu var.",
      "summary_tr_long": "How Milei's 'Thatcherite' economics divided his nation - but won over Trump Ione Wells South America Correspondent BBC Buenos Aires, September 2023. In 2019, he dressed up in a \"libertarian superhero\" costume, purporting to be from Liberland - a land where no taxes are paid. In 2018, he smashed a piñata of the Central Bank on live television. According to official data, inflation in 2023 topped 211% annually - Milei took office in December of that year. Roughly 40% of the population lived in poverty. Yet nearly two years on, the headline figures are vastly different: Argentina recorded its first fiscal surplus in 14 years and inflation, which had hit triple figures annually, has tumbled to roughly 36%. The UK Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch called the measures Milei has taken a \"template\" for a future Conservative government. And in the US, President Donald Trump described Milei as \"my favourite president\". Although that recently slipped, Washington's decision last week to swap $20bn (£15bn) in dollars for pesos, effectively propping up Argentina's currency with International Monetary Fund (IMF) backing, is a sign Milei's fiscal shock therapy has appeased international lenders. \"The adjustment in the end was directed at the working classes, not the caste.\" Reuters Milei's reforms have prompted heated protests Milei's critics argue that the price of his changes have been recession, job losses, weaker public services and declining household budgets. With midterm elections looming on 26 October, Argentina is about to deliver its verdict: will Milei be punished for doing what he set out to do — and could losing political support completely unravel his economic gains? Argentines feeling the cost Around 700 miles from the capital in the Misiones province, tea farmer Ygor Sobol looks anxious. Now I am completely without employees.\" For three generations his family has grown yerba mate, a drink popular with Argentines, but since Milei deregulated his industry by scrapping minimum prices, he says that his crops have become worth less than the cost of producing them. \"I have environmental controls, labour controls - we don't pay people $80 (£60) a month, or have 16-hour work days that might be allowed in places like Bangladesh or Vietnam. \"Our sector lost more than 10,000 direct jobs. Public spending was high, even before the Covid-19 pandemic. Argentina, still, owes £31bn in debt to the IMF. Or didn't recognise that inflation was a product of so much public spending.\" EPA - EFE/REX/Shutterstock Opponents of Javier Milei say ordinary people have been left with less disposable income Inflation ate away the peso currency's purchasing power. He went viral for ripping government ministries such as Culture and Women off a whiteboard while shouting 'afuera!' - 'out!' Among other austerity measures, he halved government ministries, cut tens of thousands of public jobs, slashed budgets including for education, health, pensions and infrastructure, and removed subsidies – spiking utility and transport prices. His initial devaluing of the peso by 50% caused inflation to spike but then it fell as people spent less and demand fell. EPA/Shutterstock Milei's supporters credit him with taming Argentina's previously rampant inflation 'Echoes of Thatcherism' When I met him in April 2024 at his office, there were sculptures of him with a chainsaw on display and coasters showing Margaret Thatcher's face. Reuters Javier Milei's reforms have drawn comparisons with those of Margaret Thatcher He believes this will help alleviate poverty in the long-run and enable lower taxes, but also help people to plan their own spending more easily with inflation currently fluctuating less. On 7 September Milei's party lost unexpectedly badly in the Buenos Aires provincial elections. EPA - EFE/REX/Shutterstock Some observers say Milei displays a lack of empathy towards those affected by cuts Financial markets had generally supported his economic programme. But the midterm elections were upcoming and the £15bn of debt repayments are due next year. Trump's £15bn currency swap lifeline has provided some stability: Argentine bonds and the peso rose in value in response to the announcement. But D'Alessandro argues that though US intervention might solve a wider problem, nothing will change in \"people's real lives\". Some of Milei's supporters - like Mr Boggiano - believe there is something else at play in the round criticism of the president: In this view much of it comes down to the opposition trying to \"break\" what Milei has done, in order to get back into power. Meanwhile, Argentina owes $20bn of debt next year. The left-wing governor of Buenos Aires, Axel Kicillof, has been touted as a future presidential candidate, long ahead of the elections in 2027. Still, he believes it is too early to judge: \"We are in the middle of his term… The story hasn't finished.\" Top picture credit: WPA Pool/Getty Images, Bloomberg via Getty Images BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Ukrayna, yaklaşık 10 saat boyunca devam eden saldırılarda en az 2 kişinin hayatını kaybettiğini, 44 kişinin yaralandığını bildirdi. Ukrayna Devlet Başkanı Volodimir Zelenski, Rusya'nın saldırılarda Kinzhal balistik füzeleri ile İran yapımı Shahed dronları kullandığını kaydetti. Kiev Acil Servisi'nin verdiği bilgiye göre, şehir genelinde çıkan yangınlar bir oto tamir atölyesi ile konut binalarını etkiledi. Alevlerin yayılması nedeniyle bir bakım evinde kalan yaşlı sakinler tahliye edilmek zorunda kaldı. Bölge sakinleri, cumartesi günü boyunca aralıklarla duyulan hava saldırısı sirenleriyle tedirginlik yaşadı. Ukrayna Devlet Başkanı Volodimir Zelenski, Rusya'nın öncelikli hedefinin başkentin enerji ve sivil altyapısı olduğunu ifade etti. Zelenski, Kiev'in bazı semtlerinde elektrik ve doğal gazın kesildiğini belirtti. Yangın söndürme çalışmalarının sürdüğü duyuruldu. 2025'TE EN UZUN SÜRELİ SALDIRI Kanada'nın Halifax kentinde basın mensuplarının sorularını yanıtlayan Zelenski, Rusya'nın 2025'te Kiev'e yönelik en uzun süreli hava saldırısını düzenlediği bilgisini verdi. Ukrayna lideri, bu saldırıların Rusya Devlet Başkanı Vladimir Putin'in barış istemediğini gösterdiğini savundu ve Rusya'nın saldırılarına karşı koymak için daha fazla füzeye ihtiyaç duyulduğunu ifade etti. Zelenski, Ukrayna'nın hava savunmasının güçlendirilmesi gerektiğini vurgulayarak, \"Biz barış istiyoruz. Avrupalıların desteği bugün bizim için önemli. Yeterli ek hava savunma sistemimiz yok\" ifadelerini kullandı. TRUMP İLE GÖRÜŞME ÖNCESİ KANADA'DAN DESTEK Zelenski, ABD Başkanı Donald Trump ile Florida'da yapacağı görüşme öncesi Kanadalı yetkililerle temaslarda bulundu. Kanada Başbakanı Mark Carney, Zelenski ile görüşmesinin ardından Ukrayna'ya 2.5 milyar Kanada doları tutarında ek ekonomik yardım yapılacağını duyurdu. Kanadalı bir hükümet kaynağı, bu yardım paketinin Uluslararası Para Fonu'nun Ukrayna'ya ek kredi açmasını sağlayacağını bildirdi. KİEV'DE ÖLÜ VE YARALILAR VAR Kiev, cumartesi günü 2025'in en uzun süreli ve yoğun hava saldırısına maruz kaldı. Rusya'nın 10 saat süren füze ve İHA saldırılarında 2 kişinin öldüğü, 2'si çocuk 44 kişinin yaralandığı bildirildi. Ukrayna Başbakan Yardımcısı Oleksiy Kuleba, sosyal medya paylaşımında, dondurucu soğuklar yaşanan Kiev'de konutların yüzde 40'ından fazlasında saldırılar nedeniyle ısıtma sistemlerinin çalışmadığını kaydetti. Saldırı nedeniyle çıkan yangınları söndürme çalışmaları devam ediyor. Cumartesi gecesi boyunca siren seslerinin susmadığı Kiev'de, halk geceyi metro istasyonları ve sığınaklarda geçirdi. POLONYA, SAVAŞ UÇAKLARINI HAVALANDIRDI Rusya'nın saldırılarına karşılık olarak Polonya, hava sahasını korumak amacıyla savaş uçaklarını havalandırdı ve iki havaalanını geçici süreyle trafiğe kapattı. Ukrayna Hava Kuvvetleri, Rusya'nın gece boyunca toplam 519 insansız hava aracı ve 40 füze fırlattığını duyurdu. Zelenski, Rusya'nın saldırıda Kinzhal balistik füzeleri ve İran yapımı Shahed dronları kullandığını bildirdi. Başkent Kiev'de enerji altyapısı ile sivil altyapının ağır hasar aldığı kaydedildi. ABD GÖRÜŞMELERDEN UMUTLU ABD'li yetkililer, Zelenski ile Trump arasında pazar günü yapılacak görüşmenin verimli geçeceği konusunda umutlu olduklarını belirtti. Yetkililer, görüşmenin özel bir amacından bahsetmezken, Zelenski daha önce Axios'a verdiği demeçte savaşı sona erdirecek bir çerçeve oluşturmak istediğini ifade etmişti. CNN International'ın haberine göre, Avrupalı yetkililer, Ukraynalıların aylardır Zelenski ile Trump arasında bir görüşme ayarlanması için çaba harcadığını söyledi. ABD ve Ukrayna arasındaki mevcut dinamikleri \"verimli\" diye niteleyen yetkililer, olumlu bir görüşme bekliyor. Öte yandan Avrupa, Trump ile yapılacak herhangi bir görüşmenin sonucunun tahmin edilemez olduğunu da kabul ediyor. Bir NATO yetkilisi, \"Trump ile ilgili düşük riskli bir senaryo yok\" yorumunu yaptı. Zelenski, pazar günü yapılacak toplantıya hazırlık amacıyla cuma günü NATO, Kanada, Almanya, Finlandiya, Danimarka ve Estonya liderleriyle görüştüğünü ve pozisyonlarını koordine ettiğini açıkladı. BARIŞ GÖRÜŞMELERİNDEKİ SON DURUM Zelenski, Trump ile yapacağı görüşmede, Ukrayna'nın herhangi bir barış anlaşmasında \"yasal olarak bağlayıcı güvenlik garantileri alacağına dair işaret arayacağını\" dile getirdi. Zelenski, Rusya'nın Ukrayna ile ABD tarafından hazırlanan barış planına katılmaması halinde Moskova'ya yönelik baskının artırılması gerektiğini öne sürdü. Rusya barış görüşmelerinde yapıcı bir tutum sergilemezse, mevcut baskının yeterli olmayacağını belirten Zelenski, konuyu Trump ile görüşmek istediğini açıkladı. Zelenski, son barış teklifine Kremlin'den resmi bir yanıt gelmediğini, Kiev'in yalnızca Washington ile müzakere yürüttüğünü ve Washington'ın da Moskova ile iletişim halinde olduğunu kaydetti. Politico'ya röportaj veren Trump, Zelenski ile görüşmesinin iyi geçmesini beklediğini ifade etti. Trump, \"Ukrayna Devlet Başkanı'nın, ABD'den onay almadıkça hiçbir şeyi olmadığını\" sözlerine ekledi. Trump, Putin ile de yakında görüşmeyi umduğunu duyurdu. Rusya Devlet Başkanı Vladimir Putin ise Ukrayna'da savaşı bitirmek için devam eden diplomatik girişimlerde ilerleme kaydedildiği bilgisini paylaşarak, \"Eğer Kiev meseleyi barışçıl yollarla çözmeye yanaşmazsa, Rusya operasyonun tüm hedeflerini askeri yollarla gerçekleştirecektir\" dedi. Putin, Ukrayna 'yı barış görüşmelerinde \"samimi\" davranmamakla suçluyor. Rusya , Ukrayna'nın barış planında değişiklikler talep etmesini \"savaşın bitmesini engellemek\" diye nitelemişti. Ukrayna, Rusya'nın taleplerini \"aşırı\" ve \"gerçek dışı\" olduğu gerekçesiyle kabule etmemişti. Trump ve Zelenski'nin Florida'da gerçekleştireceği görüşme sonrası, Trump'ın Putin ile bir zirve düzenleyebileceği belirtildi.",

Real Madrid'in yıldızı Arda Güler ve Juventus'un starı Kenan Yıldız için İspanyol basını, sürpriz gelişmeyi okuyucularına aktardı. İddiaya göre Kenan Yıldız ve Arda Güler ' transfer ' gündeme geldi. Konuya ilişkin yer alan haber şu şekilde oldu: \"Arda Güler, Xabi Alonso için en önemli oyunculardan biri haline geldi. Bu nedenle bu sezon karşılaşmaların büyük bölümünde ilk 11’de forma giyiyor. İspanyol teknik adam, Arda’nın teknik kalitesinin kesinlikle heba edilmemesi gerektiğini düşünüyor. Çünkü genç futbolcu, üst düzey oyun görüşüne ve birçok oyuncunun sahip olmak isteyeceği nitelikte bir son pas yeteneğine sahip. UZUN SÜREN SÖZLEŞMESİ VAR Real Madrid'de Arda Güler’in sözleşmesini uzatma konusunda acele yok. Bunun en önemli nedeni, genç yıldızın kontratında yer alan ve Avrupa’nın elit kulüplerinin bile ödemekte zorlanacağı seviyedeki yüksek serbest kalma bedeli. Arda’nın sözleşmesi 30 Haziran 2029 tarihinde sona eriyor. Bu da kulübe, yeni sözleşme için önünde uzun bir zaman olduğu anlamına geliyor. Amaç, ekonomik şartlar üzerinde uzlaşı sağlamak ve Arda’nın daha uzun yıllar Madrid formasını giymesini sağlamak. Elbette Arda’nın takımda kalıcı olup olmaması, sahadaki performansıyla da doğrudan bağlantılı olacak. Şu ana kadar oldukça iyi bir grafik çizen genç futbolcunun, Jude Bellingham’ın geri dönüşüyle birlikte performansında bir miktar düşüş yaşadığı ifade ediliyor. Bunun temel nedeni ise pozisyonunun biraz değişmesi. İki oyuncu farklı özelliklere sahip olsa da sahada benzer alanları kullanmaları uyumu zorlaştırıyor. Ancak Xabi Alonso, bu sorunu çözeceğinden emin. YENİ ROL PLANI Arda Güler’in ideal pozisyonu 10 numara olarak görülse de Xabi Alonso’nun planı, genç yıldızı biraz daha geriye çekerek farklı bir rolde değerlendirmek. İspanyol teknik adam, Arda’nın sahip olduğu özelliklerle takımın oyununu daha geriden yönlendirebileceğine inanıyor. Ancak bu değişim bir süreç gerektiriyor ve bu süreçte hem doğru kararlar hem de hatalar yaşanabiliyor. Real Madrid’in de bu duruma sabır göstermesi gerekiyor. Zira kulüp, bu pozisyon için ayrıca yaratıcı profilde bir oyuncu transfer etmemeyi tercih etti. Şu anda Arda Güler elinden gelenin en iyisini yapmaya çalışıyor ancak kendisi de çok daha iyisini ortaya koyabileceğinin farkında. Genç yıldızın yeni rolüne alışması için zamana ve sabra ihtiyacı var. Başlangıçta hataların artması futbolun doğasında var. Arda’nın da zamanla bu pozisyona tamamen uyum sağlaması bekleniyor. KENAN - ARDA TAKASI TEKLİF EDİLDİ Arda'nın yükselen form grafiği, Avrupa'nın dev takımlarının da ilgisini çekiyor. Juventus, Kenan Yıldız ile sözleşme yenileme konusunda yaşadığı zorluklar nedeniyle, gelecek sezon için Real Madrid ’e Arda Güler karşılığında takas ihtimalini gündeme getirdi. Torino ekibi, Madrid'de Kenan Yıldız'ın çok beğenildiğini biliyor. Ancak çeşitli dijital platformlarda yer alan bu iddialar doğru olsa bile, Real Madrid cephesi Arda’nın takımdan ayrılmasını kesinlikle düşünmüyor. Şu an itibarıyla kulüp, Türk futbolcuyu hem bugünün hem de geleceğin kilit parçası olarak görüyor.\" VIDEO",

Fort Ord, 1917 yılında ABD’de Kaliforniya’da kuruldu ve 1994 yılına kadar faaliyet gösterdi. Ancak zamanla, Fort Ord sadece askeri eğitimleriyle değil, aynı zamanda çevresine yayılan kimyasal maddelerle de gündeme gelmeye başladı. Vietnam Savaşı sırasında kötü şöhretiyle bilinen Agent Orange ( Portakal Gazı ) ve benzeri herbisitlerin kullanıldığı iddiaları, üssün tarihini yeniden tartışmaya açtı. AGENT ORANGE VE HERBİSİTLER: BU ZEHİRLİ KİMYASALLAR NEDİR? Agent Orange, özellikle Vietnam Savaşı sırasında kullanılan ve bitki örtüsünü yok etmek amacıyla geliştirilen bir kimyasal karışım. İçeriğinde 2,4-D ve 2,4,5-T adlı iki herbisit bulunur. Bilimsel araştırmalara göre bu ve benzeri dioksinler: Kanser (özellikle multipl miyelom, akciğer ve lenfoma) Bağışıklık sistemi bozuklukları Nörolojik rahatsızlıklar Diyabet ve kalp hastalıkları Doğum kusurları gibi ciddi sağlık sorunlarına yol açabiliyor. Ayrıca, toprak ve yeraltı sularında on yıllarca kalabiliyor, çevresel kirlilik yaratıyor ve yıllar sonra bile insan sağlığını tehdit edebiliyor. Kuzey ve Güney Vietnam arasında sıkışan ülke, taraflarca stratejik hedeflerin denendiği bir laboratuvar gibi kullanıldı. Amerikan güçleri, ormanlık alanlarda savaşan düşmanlarını tespit etmek ve kaynaklarını yok etmek amacıyla yoğun bitki örtüsünü hedef alan sıra dışı yöntemlere başvurdu. “Gökkuşağı Herbisitleri” adı verilen bu maddeler, renkli galonlarda depolanıyor ve özellikle “Agent Orange” olarak bilinen türü savaşın simgesi hâline geliyordu. 1961-1971 yılları arasında yürütülen “Ranch Hand” operasyonu sırasında milyonlarca litre bu yaprak dökücü, milyonlarca hektarlık arazide kullanıldı. Bugün, o dönemde yaşanan tahribat ve kimyasalların etkileri hâlâ Vietnam’da üç nesli etkileyen bir miras bırakmış durumda. ‘DÜNYAM BAŞIMA YIKILDI’ 1990’larda Fort Ord’da görev yapan Julie Akey ise 2016 yılında ani kemik ağrıları ve bitmek bilmeyen yorgunluk yaşamaya başladı. Kolombiya’daki Bogota büyükelçiliğinde çalışırken semptomları giderek kötüleşti ve kısa süre sonra ambulans helikopteriyle Ohio’daki Cleveland Kliniği’ne sevk edildi. Bu hastalık, kemik iliğinde bulunan plazma hücrelerinin kontrolsüz şekilde çoğalmasıyla ortaya çıkan bir kan kanseri türü. Ben 46 yaşındaydım, sağlıklıyım ve bu hiç mantıklı gelmiyordu” diyerek süreci anlattı. “46 yaşında kanser olacağımı hiç düşünmezdim. Cevap aramaya başladım.” Fotoğraflar: Associated Press (AP) ÜSSÜN ZEHİRLİ MİRASINA YOLCULUK Teşhis sonrası Julie Akey, Fort Ord’un tarihini, üs kayıtlarını, gaziler forumlarını ve uzun yıllar unutulmuş raporları incelemeye başladı. Araştırmaları, üssün onlarca yıl boyunca Agent Orange ve benzeri herbisitleri kullanarak zehirli meşe ve yabani otları yok ettiğini ortaya koydu. Bu veri tabanı, göz ardı edilemeyecek bir örüntü ortaya koyuyor: Akciğer kanseri, lenfoma, yumurtalık kanseri ve boyun-boğaz kanseri gibi hastalıklar, Fort Ord’la bağlantılı olabilecek vakalar arasında yer alıyor. MULTİPL MİYELOM VE ÜS İSTATİSTİKLERİ Akey, “Miyelom, tüm yeni kanser vakalarının yüzde 2’sini oluşturuyor. Ancak Fort Ord verilerinde bu oran yüzde 15 ila 20’ye yakın. Fort Ord, Agent Orange’ın depolandığı, test edildiği veya kullanıldığı bilinen en az 17 ABD askeri tesisinden biri. Ancak resmî kayıtlar, üssün bu kimyasallara maruz kaldığını doğrulamıyor ve Gaziler Dairesi (VA), Fort Ord’u Agent Orange ile ilişkili sağlık sorunları listesinin dışında tutuyor. Bilim insanları, Agent Orange’ın yalnızca hemen gözle görülen etkilerinin değil, uzun vadede genetik düzeyde de zararlar verebileceğini belirtiyor. Vietnam’da yapılan araştırmalar, bu maddeye maruz kalanlarda ortaya çıkan bazı sağlık sorunlarının, sonraki kuşaklara da taşınabileceğini gösteriyor. Bölge doktorları ve bilim insanları, maruziyetin üçüncü nesilde doğuştan bedensel veya zihinsel farklılıklarla dünyaya gelen çocukların sayısında artışa yol açtığını kaydediyor. EMEKLİ UZMANLARDAN YENİ KANITLAR Emekli kimya mühendisi Denise Trabbic-Pointer, Fort Ord ’da 1950’lerden itibaren 2,4-D ve 2,4,5-T içeren herbisitlerin yaygın olarak kullanıldığını iddia ediyor. Denise, 1980 tarihli bir ordu mektubunun, 1973’ten itibaren yüzlerce dönümlük alanlara bu kimyasalların uygulandığını belgelediğini söylüyor. Tehlikeli atık kayıtları, üssün Agent Orange ile ilgili atıkları nasıl depoladığını ve imha ettiğini de detaylı şekilde gösteriyor. Akey ve diğer araştırmacılar, üste görev yaptıktan sonra çeşitli kanser türleri ve sağlık sorunları yaşayan gazilerin sayısının arttığını belirtiyor. ABD’DE DİĞER ÜSLER VE AGENT ORANGE İZLERİ Fort Ord yalnız değil. Mississippi’deki Gulfport Deniz İnşaat Tabur Merkezi, 1968-1977 arasında yaklaşık 840 bin galon Agent Orange depoladı. Florida’daki Eglin Hava Kuvvetleri Üssü’nde 1952-1969 arasında havadan püskürtme testleri yapıldı. Hawaii’de Hilo şehrinde 1966’da kısa süreli Agent Orange depolama ve sızıntı kaygıları yaşandı. Bugün, Fort Ord ve benzeri bölgelerde yapılan testler, kimyasalların yeraltı sularına ve hava yoluyla hareket etmeye devam ettiğini gösteriyor. BAZI BÖLGELERDEKİ KANSER ORANLARI ÜLKE ORTALAMASININ ÇOK ÜZERİNDE Harrison County (Mississippi): 100.000 kişide 470 vaka Okaloosa County (Florida): 100.000 kişide 450 vaka Hawaii County: 100.000 kişide 410 vaka Henüz bu rakamlar doğrudan Agent Orange’a bağlanmasa da araştırmacılar, veri eksikliğinin daha fazla araştırma yapılması gerektiğini ortaya koyduğunu vurguluyor. AGENT ORANGE MARUZİYETİ SONRASI HAYATINI KAYBETTİ Vietnam’da yaklaşık üç milyon Amerikalı görev yaptı, ancak ABD içindeki üslerde eğitim gören askerler ve civardaki siviller çok daha az dikkat çekti. New Jersey’den Julie DiMaria, kocasının Agent Orange maruziyeti sonrası geçirdiği kalp krizi ve felç nedeniyle genç yaşta hayatını kaybettiğini anlatıyor: “Neredeyse 60 yıl sonra bile etkiler devam ediyor ve insanlar bunun farkında bile değil.” Akey ve diğer araştırmacılar, Fort Ord ve benzeri üslerde Agent Orange kullanımının açığa çıkarılması ve etkilerinin resmî olarak tanınması için çalışmalarını sürdürüyor. Bu süreç, hem eski askerlerin hem de çevrede yaşayan sivillerin sağlık haklarının korunması açısından kritik öneme sahip.",
