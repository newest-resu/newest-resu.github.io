      "title": "Tesla Model Y",
      "summary": "Europe's biggest-selling electric car gets some key refinements and improvements, and an entry-level model that champions value for money\n\nThe primacy of the Tesla Model Y - still the best-selling electric car in both the UK and Europe - is slowly fading. Back in 2023, after production at Tesla’s European ‘gigafactory’ in Berlin fully ramped up, this was Europe’s fastest-selling new car of any kind. In 2024, however, it dropped out of the continent’s ‘big three’ - and now seems less and less likely to return.Not that Tesla’s taking this lying down. Late last year, the firm announced this new entry-rung, ‘Standard’ version of the Model Y. At list price, it costs £3000 less than the equivalent bottom-rung model (the RWD) did in 2022, and about £7000 less than the next model up in the lineup.But the car’s headline price is only half of the story. By optimising both equipment specification and performance, Tesla has produced lower cost of insurance and stronger residuals for it; the latter driving value through all-important personal finance. Tesla's manufacturer-backed PCP deals on the Model Y Standard car start at just £300-a-month - the kind of outlay EV owners will be more accustomed to paying for considerably smaller, shorter-range cars from classes below. They could actually be cheaper still once you factor in the £3750 deposit booster offer that the firm is currently offering, to buyers trading in either combustion-engined cars or competitor EVs.As regards the wider Model Y model lineup, a fairly wide-ranging update was executed in 2025. Beyond striking changes to the body, they included a Cybertruck-style front lightbar, and myriad other tweaks to constituted the so-called Juniper facelift.At the same time, pricing was made more competitive than ever. When the Model Y first landed in the UK in 2022, a 434bhp Long Range variant with four-wheel drive would set you back £54,990. Today the same model is marginally less powerful but costs an inflation-busting £51,990, despite having additional kit that includes ventilated front seats and electrically folding rear seatbacks.It’s a strong twin-prong attack. One with a whiff of Hail Mary? Perhaps. So far we've tested both the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive, to which our various figures and charts relate; the Long Range dual-motor car; and the bottom-rung Model Y Standard. The Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive is the mid-ranking Model Y with a declared range of 387 miles and an asking price of £48,990. The list of cars you might conceivably cross-shop with the Tesla is now vastly greater than it was even three years ago, and many of them sit on fresh platforms and certainly aren’t shy when it comes to battery capacity and performance. Tesla has long been a technology leader, but there’s no denying the rest of the world has caught up.Does the hitherto formidable Model Y still cut it? And can some boosted value credentials give it a new lease of life? Let's find out.",

Arrow Video's stellar 4K Blu-ray edition of David Lynch's Dune is up for grabs for only $21.80 (was $50). Dune is one of many 4K Blu-rays in Amazon's 50% off Arrow Video movies promotion; it's also not the only Dune adaptation on 4K Blu-ray for super cheap right now.Save over 50% on Dune 4K Blu-rays:David Lynch's Dune -- $21.80 ($50)Dune: Prophecy Season 1 -- $17 ($40) with couponDune: Part One -- $14.49 ($30)Dune: Part Two -- $15 ($30)The ultra-violent and often disorienting film was exceedingly unpopular with critics and fans, but it has garnered a cult following over the years. It's a fascinating adaptation that's worth revisiting, and Arrow Video's 4K Blu-ray edition is the best way to watch it today. If you're at all interested in Dune or David Lynch or the filmmaking process, I'd highly recommend pairing the 4K Blu-ray with the massive behind-the-scenes book titled A Masterpiece in Disarray: David Lynch's Dune, An Oral History. The 560-page, limited-edition book is thoroughly entertaining--and it doesn't hurt that it doubles as a stunning display piece.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

      "summary": "The middle of Overwatch 2 Season 20 has arrived, and the midcycle is bringing the chaos with new modes, new loot, and new in-game collectibles. One of the most notable new additions is Showdown Shuffle, which runs January 13-26. This mode is going to change which character you're controlling, often at random intervals.Showdown Shuffle locks players into a role, but not a particular hero. Instead, hero swaps can occur when players reach certain milestones for kills or assists, or even when players are eliminated. According to Blizzard, this was done to encourage players to experiment with new characters and adapt on the fly. Showdown Shuffle will be a 5v5 battle available in Control, Hybrid, Escort, Push, and Flashpoint. Match modifiers will also change throughout the battle for more unpredictable outcomes.Starting today through January 11, Assault will return during a Quick Play Hacked event that brings back classic Overwatch maps Temple of Anubis, Hanamura, and Volskaya Industries. It's a fitting start the year, considering that 2026 will mark the 10th anniversary of Overwatch.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Thia is a Weyland-Yutani Corporation synthetic who lost her legs in battle. She defies her programming and teams up with Dek, who builds a backpack-style wheelchair to carry her throughout the hunt. This unique setup leads to some inventive action sequences. Tessa, meanwhile, is the primary antagonist in Badlands. Fanning does a great job portraying both characters, and Koloamatangi's performance as the new Predator is superb.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Both sides have held firm since the initial accusations, and now the battle has gone to court in the UK.As reported by Video Games Chronicle, Rockstar and the IWGB went before the court earlier this week, where the latter requested that the fired workers be given \"interim relief\" while the legal drama plays out. If granted, that would place the affected workers back on Rockstar's payroll and allow some to keep their visas that were reliant on their jobs. The court will reportedly decide on the matter before the end of the week.The IWGB pledged to continue fighting for the workers regardless of the court's decision, while Rockstar reiterated its position that the workers broke the company's policy.Continue Reading at GameSpot",
